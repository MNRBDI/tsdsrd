  "content": "Section 4.6: MANAGING RISKS IN CONSTRUCTION AREAS\n\nOBSERVATION:\nConstruction activities pose unique safety and security challenges, particularly in occupied \nbuildings where ongoing operations may expose workers, visitors, and assets to hazards. \nTo minimize these risks and ensure compliance with safety standards, the following \nmeasures are recommended for construction areas, specifically for the new third and \nfourth floors.  \n \n- Designate a Responsible Safety Officer  \n - Secure Construction Zones  \n - Implement Regular Monitoring and Patrols\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\n1. Designate a Responsible Safety Officer  \nRecommendation:  \nIn alignment with Section 3.1.1 of FM Global’ s  Safeguards During Construction, \nAlteration, and Demolition, designate one individual responsible for overseeing safety and \nsecurity measures in the construction areas. This person should:  \n \n- Have full authority to enforce fire, safety, and security protocols.  \n- Conduct at least one round of inspection each working day.  \n- Ensure adherence to safety standards, including the control of fire hazards, and \nsupervise access control to construction zones.  \n \nPurpose and Benefits:  \nEnsures accountability for hazard mitigation and the enforcement of safety protocols.  \nPromotes a centralized approach to managing risks such as fire, wind damage, \nvandalism, theft, and unauthorized access.  \n \n2. Secure Construction Zones  \nRecommendation:  \nEnsure that construction zones on the third and fourth floors are properly barricaded and \nclearly marked as restricted areas to prevent unauthorized access by the insured’s \nworkers and other personnel. Use signage to indicate hazards such as falling debris, \nelectrical work, or restricted access.  \n \nPurpose and Benefits:  \nReduces the risk of accidents, such as falls or injuries, caused by untrained individuals \nentering construction zones.  \nLimits liability for injuries resulting from unauthorized access.  \n \n3. Implement Regular Monitoring and Patrols  \nRecommendation:  \nAssign dedicated personnel to monitor and patrol the construction zones at regular \nintervals. This ensures that:  \n - Unauthorized personnel do not enter restricted areas.  \n - Safety protocols, such as fire hazard control, are being followed.  \n - Any hazards or anomalies are identified and addressed promptly.  \n \nPurpose and Benefits:  \nEnsures ongoing compliance with safety measures.  \nQuickly identifies and mitigates risks before they escalate into incidents.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\n1. Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994 (OSHA 1994):  \nSection 15 mandates that employers provide a safe working environment by identifying \nand mitigating risks, including those related to construction activities.  \nSection 24 obligates employees to cooperate in safety measures implemented by the \nemployer.  \n \n2. Factories and Machinery Act 1967 (FMA 1967):  \nOutlines the requirements for safe access and egress from work areas, including the use \nof ladders, scaffolds, and other equipment.  \n \n3. Occupational Safety and Health (Use and Standards of Exposure to Hazardous \nChemicals) Regulations 2000:  \nRequires the identification and communication of hazards in work areas, including \nconstruction zones.  \n \n4. Factories and Machinery (Safety, Health, and Welfare) Regulations 1970:  \nRegulation 32 Outlines the working clothes and personal protective clothing in worksites to \nensure safety conditions.",
