  "content": "Section 5.7: THICKNESS TESTING OF BULK TANKS\n\nOBSERVATION:\nThe bulking facilities have been operating since 2008, but the thickness test for the tanks \nhas not been conducted since the start of operations.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nThe thickness testing of bulk storage tanks is conducted to assess the condition and \nintegrity of the tank's structure. This test ensures that the tank's walls, particularly the \nbottom and shell, are still thick enough to withstand the operational pressures and are \nsafe for continued use. The testing is typically performed on above -ground storage tanks \nused for petroleum, chemicals, and other bulk liquids.  \n \nIt is recommended that a thickness test for the tanks be conducted promptly to assess \ntheir structural integrity and ensure continued safe operation. Moving forward, thickness \ntesting should be scheduled based on industry standards as follows:  \n \n• Initial Test: To be conducted immediately to establish the current condition of the \ntanks.  \n \n• Subsequent Tests: Thickness tests should be carried out every 5 years in \naccordance with standard industry practices (e.g., API 653 for storage tanks).  \n \n• Additional Testing: If any significant corrosion or structural issues are identified, \nadditional tests should be scheduled based on the severity of the findings and the \nrecommendations from the inspection report.  \n \nThis approach will help prevent potential failures and maintain compliance with safety \nstandards.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\nEnsuring the structural integrity and safety of storage tanks is paramount in industrial \noperations. Several standards and guidelines govern the inspection, maintenance, and \nrepair of these tanks. Below is an overview of key international and Malaysian standards.  \n \n1. API 650 (American Petroleum Institute ) - Welded Tanks for Oil Storage  \n• Scope: API 650 provides the standards for the design, fabrication, and inspection \nof welded steel tanks for the storage of petroleum and other liquids, which includes \npalm oil.  \n• Relevance: This standard is widely used for bulk storage tanks, including palm oil \ntanks, as it specifies the minimum requirements for the tank's material, design, \nconstruction, and safety. For palm oil tanks, particularly those storing crude palm \noil or refined palm oil, API 650 ensures that the tank is designed to withstand the \ninternal pressures, temperatures, and other mechanical stresses while maintaining \nstructural integrity over time.  \n• Design Criteria:  \no Material Selection: The material must be compatible with the chemical \nproperties of the stored liquid (e.g., palm oil).  \no Thickness of Tank Shell and Bottom: The standard specifies calculations for \ndetermining the minimum thickness based on the size, pressure, and type of liquid being stored.  \no Corrosion Allowance: A corrosion allowance is typically added to ensure the \ntank maintains integrity over its service life, particularly at the bottom where \nwater accumulation and contamination might accelerate corrosion.  \n \n• Inspection & Maintenance:  \no API 650 requires regular inspections of tanks, including ultrasonic thickness \nmeasurements and visual inspections, to identify areas of corrosion or \nthinning.  \no It also recommends periodic hydrostatic testing (filling the tank with water \nto check for leaks), especially after repairs or modifications.  \n• Acceptance Criteria:  \no If the thickness of the tank wall falls below the allowable thickness defined \nby the design, repairs or replacement of the affected section are required.  \n \n2. API 653 (American Petroleum Institute)  - Tank Inspection, Repair, Alteration, and \nReconstruction  \n• Scope: API 653 deals specifically with the inspection, repair, and maintenance of \nabove -ground storage tanks (ASTs). It is directly applicable to bulk storage tanks \nused for palm oil.  \n• Relevance: This standard is used once a storage tank is in service and needs \nongoing inspection and maintenance. It complements API 650 by providing specific \nguidance for post -construction activities.  \n• Inspection & Maintenance:  \no Ultrasonic Thickness Testing: API 653 provides guidelines on when and \nhow to perform thickness testing to assess the level of corrosion, especially \nat critical points like the tank bottom and welds.  \no Tank Cleaning: Palm oil tanks need to be cleaned regularly to remove \nsediment and microbial growth, especially at the tank bottom where water \nand oil residue can accumulate.  \no Repair and Alteration: If corrosion or thinning exceeds allowable limits, the \ntank may require repair or alteration, such as replacing corroded plates or \nadding reinforcement.  \n• Structural Integrity: API 653 requires the tank to undergo a comprehensive \ninspection, including checking for leakages, deformation, and any signs of \noverstress. Tanks with significant corrosion or defects should be derated (used \nunder lower operating conditions) until repairs are made.  \n \n3. MS 1984: Part 2  - Storage Tanks for Petroleum Products and Other Liquids (Malaysian \nStandard)  \n• Scope: This standard, aligned with API 650, is the Malaysian Standard for \ndesigning, constructing, and maintaining storage tanks for various liquids, including \npalm oil.  \n• Relevance: MS 1984 Part 2 applies to storage tanks for liquids like palm oil and \nsets the local benchmarks for tank construction, safety, and inspections. It ensures \nthat tanks meet both local regulations and international standards.  \n• Design Requirements:  \no Corrosion Allowance: The standard requires a corrosion allowance for the \ntank shell and bottom to accommodate the effects of palm oil's chemical \ncomposition, especially free fatty acids (FFAs) and moisture that may \naccelerate corrosion.  \no Seismic and Wind Load Considerations: As Malaysia is prone to tropical storms, MS 1984 includes guidelines for tanks to withstand high winds, \nespecially if the tanks are located in areas susceptible to such conditions.  \n• Inspection and Maintenance:  \no Similar to API 650, this standard recommends periodic thickness \nmeasurements and visual inspections.  \no Leak testing and structural checks are mandatory as part of tank \ninspections to ensure there are no cracks or potential leaks, especially \nwhen the tank is storing edible products like palm oil.  \n \n4. ASME  (American Society of Mechanical Engineers)  - Boiler and Pressure Vessel \nCode  \n• Scope: ASME standards are used for pressure vessels and other tanks that \noperate under pressure. While this is not always directly applicable to storage \ntanks, certain types of palm oil storage tanks that are pressurized or have heating \nsystems (e.g., for crude palm oil storage) may follow these standards.  \n• Relevance: If the storage tank is designed to withstand internal pressures (such as \nhigh-temperature crude palm oil storage), ASME standards will apply to ensure the \ntank can withstand operational stresses without failure.  \n• Design Criteria:  \no The ASME code will specify material strength, corrosion allowances, and \npressure relief requirements for tanks operating at elevated temperatures \nor pressures.  \n• Inspection and Testing:  \no For pressurized tanks, ASME standards require pressure testing to ensure \nstructural integrity.  \no Ultrasonic testing and radiographic testing may be used to check welds and \nareas subject to fatigue or corrosion.  \n \n5. DOSH (Department of Occupational Safety and Health, Malaysia)  Regulations  \n• Scope: DOSH regulations govern safety in the workplace and apply to the \noperation and maintenance of storage tanks used in Malaysia. These regulations \nensure that workers are not exposed to unsafe working conditions while \ninspecting, maintaining, or repairing storage tanks.  \n• Relevance: These regulations ensure that palm oil storage tank operations are \ncarried out in a safe manner, especially in terms of confined space entry, spill \ncontainment, and fire safety.  \n• Inspection & Maintenance:  \no Tanks must comply with DOSH safety guidelines when it comes to entering \nconfined spaces (tank interiors), and appropriate gas testing is required \nbefore entry.  \no Tanks must be properly maintained to prevent leaks, which could result in \nenvironmental hazards or accidents.  \n \n6. ISO 9001: Quality Management Systems  \n• Scope: ISO 9001 is a globally recognized standard for quality management \nsystems (QMS). Though it is not directly related to tank design, it plays an \nimportant role in ensuring that the maintenance and inspection processes for \nstorage tanks follow a standardized procedure.  \n• Relevance: Compliance with ISO 9001 ensures that tank maintenance procedures \nare consistent and well -documented, which is vital for ensuring the reliability and \nsafety of palm oil storage tanks.  \n• Inspection & Documentation:  o Maintenance, inspections, and repairs must be documented and follow a \nquality control process to ensure consistent performance and traceability of \nall tank -related activities.",
