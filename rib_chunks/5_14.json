  "content": "Section 5.14: PARTIAL DISCHARGE (PD) FOR UNINTERRUPTIBLE POWER SUPPLY \n(UPS)\n\nOBSERVATION:\nThe maintenance team detected increased noise and harmonic distortion in the UPS \noutput, along with elevated temperatures at cable joints and terminations. These signs \nindicated possible insulation degradation, which could lead to serious electrical failure. \nThe problem arose in a UPS data centre  that had been operating for more than two years \nwith no record of a partial discharge test being conducted.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nPartial discharge (PD) is a localized electrical discharge that occurs due to imperfections \nor damage in the insulation of high -voltage components in Uninterruptible Power Supply \n(UPS) systems. PD can take various forms, including internal discharge within solid \ninsulation, surface discharge along insulation surfaces, corona discharge in gaseous \ninsulation, and treeing caused by progressive electrical stress. PD testing is essential for \nUPS systems to detect early -stage insulation defects, assess insulation aging, and \nprevent catastrophic failures that could lead to system downtime or damage.  \nThere are several methods for detecting PD activity in UPS systems. Electrical PD \ndetection measures high -frequency current pulses using capacitive or inductive sensors, \nsuch as high -frequency current transformers (HFCT) and coupling capacitors. Ultrasonic \ndetection identifies high -frequency acoustic signals produced by PD using microphones or \nacoustic sensors, while UHF detection captures electromagnetic waves emitted by PD at \nultra-high frequencies. Optical detection uses light sensors to detect emissions from \ncorona and surface discharges. These methods allow for accurate identification of PD \nsources and the extent of insulation damage.  \n \nThe PD testing process for UPS systems involves five key steps. It starts with a pre -test \ninspection of components and installation of sensors at key points. During testing, voltage \nis applied incrementally to measure PD activity. Recorded data is analysed to determine \nPD inception voltage (PDIV), extinction voltage (PDEV), pulse magnitude, and repetition \nrate. Test results are compared to baseline data and industry standards, followed by \nrecommendations for corrective actions such as insulation repair, joint tightening, and \ncomponent replacement to prevent future failures.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\n1. IEC 60270 – High -Voltage Test Techniques – Partial Discharge Measurements  \nIEC 60270 is the primary international standard that defines the methods and \nrequirements for PD measurement in high -voltage equipment, including UPS systems.  \nKey Technical Aspects:  \n• Scope:  \no Applies to PD measurements in high -voltage components like cables, \nswitchgear, transformers, and UPS systems.  \no Provides guidelines for measuring PD in gas -insulated, liquid -insulated, \nand solid -insulated systems.  \n• PD Measurement Method:  \no Specifies the use of electrical measurement methods such as:  \n▪ High-Frequency Current Transformer (HFCT) – For monitoring PD \nin power cables.  \n▪ Coupling Capacitors – For direct measurement of PD pulses.  \n▪ Wideband and Narrowband Detection – For analyzing PD signal \npatterns.  • Testing Conditions:  \no Test voltage should be applied gradually up to 1.5 times the operating \nvoltage.  \no The test should last long enough to ensure stability in PD activity readings.  \no Background noise should be controlled to avoid interference.  \n• PD Limits:  \no PD magnitude should not exceed 10 pC for low -voltage UPS systems and \n100 pC for high -voltage UPS systems.  \no If PD magnitude exceeds acceptable limits, corrective actions such as \ninsulation repair or replacement must be taken.  \n• Data Analysis:  \no PD patterns should be classified by type (internal, surface, corona).  \no PD inception voltage (PDIV) and extinction voltage (PDEV) should be \nrecorded and analysed.  \n• Reporting:  \no Test reports should include:  \n▪ PD magnitude (in pC)  \n▪ Location of discharge  \n▪ PDIV and PDEV values  \n▪ Any corrective actions taken  \n \n2. IEEE 1434 – Guide for Partial Discharge Testing of Shielded Power Cable Systems \nin a Field Environment  \nIEEE 1434 provides comprehensive guidance for detecting and measuring PD activity in \nshielded power cable systems, which is directly applicable to UPS power connections and \ncabling.  \nKey Technical Aspects:  \n• Scope:  \no Covers both factory -based and field -based PD testing of shielded power \ncable systems.  \no Applicable to medium - and high -voltage UPS systems using shielded \ncables.  \n• Testing Techniques:  \no Electrical PD detection using:  \n▪ HFCT Sensors – Installed around the power cable for real -time PD \npulse detection.  \n▪ Capacitive Sensors – Used for sensitive PD signal measurements.  \n▪ Directional Couplers – Installed at cable joints and terminations to \nidentify PD location.  \n• PD Classification:  \no Internal PD – Within the insulation or conductor.  \no Surface PD – Across the insulation surface.  \no Corona PD – In air -filled gaps or voids.  \n• Measurement Criteria:  \no PD activity should be measured at various applied voltages to determine \nPDIV and PDEV.  \no Allowable PD levels for shielded cables in UPS systems:  \n▪ PD magnitude should remain below 100 pC for healthy systems.  \n▪ If PD magnitude exceeds 500 pC, immediate corrective action is \nrequired.  \n• Acceptance Criteria:  \no PD magnitude should not increase with increasing voltage.  \no No sustained PD activity should be present once the voltage is reduced \nbelow PDEV.  \n• Corrective Actions:  o Insulation repair or replacement.  \no Re-termination of joints or cables.  \no Shielding enhancement to reduce PD levels.  \n \n3. IEEE 400.2 – Guide for Field Testing of Shielded Power Cable Systems Using \nPartial Discharge Detection  \nIEEE 400.2 is an extension of IEEE 1434, specifically targeting PD testing in the field for \nshielded power cable systems used in UPS installations.  \nKey Technical Aspects:  \n• Scope:  \no Focuses on field testing conditions for shielded power cables.  \no Applicable to medium - and high -voltage UPS cables and terminations.  \n• Testing Techniques:  \no PD testing can be performed using:  \n▪ On-line Testing – While the UPS is operational.  \n▪ Off-line Testing – When the UPS is disconnected from the load.  \no Use of sensors:  \n▪ HFCT  \n▪ Capacitive Couplers  \n▪ Directional Couplers  \n• Voltage Application:  \no Applied voltage should range from the rated operating voltage to 1.5 times \nthe rated value.  \no Voltage should be increased gradually to allow for accurate PD inception \nmeasurement.  \n• PD Thresholds:  \no PD levels below 50 pC – System considered in good condition.  \no PD levels between 50 pC and 300 pC – Monitor closely, consider \nmaintenance.  \no PD levels above 300 pC – Immediate action required.  \n• Data Interpretation:  \no PD activity should decrease with time as voltage stabilizes.  \no PD signal pattern should be compared with baseline test data.  \no Persistent or increasing PD activity indicates insulation weakness.  \n• Corrective Actions:  \no Repair or replace degraded cable insulation.  \no Improve cable shielding or joint termination.  \no Remove contaminants causing surface discharge.  \n \n4. IEC 62478 – Measurement of Partial Discharges by Electromagnetic and Acoustic \nMethods  \nIEC 62478 outlines advanced methods for detecting PD using electromagnetic and \nacoustic signals, which are particularly useful for complex UPS installations with high \nshielding or difficult -to-access components.  \nKey Technical Aspects:  \n• Scope:  \no Applicable to PD testing in gas -insulated, liquid -insulated, and solid -\ninsulated equipment.  \no Useful for PD detection in transformer windings and high -voltage cable \nterminations.  \n• Measurement Techniques:  \no UHF Detection – Captures electromagnetic waves from PD sources.  \no Acoustic Detection – Uses ultrasonic sensors to pinpoint discharge \nlocation.  \n• Signal Filtering and Noise Reduction:  o High-frequency signals are filtered to remove background noise . \no Pattern recognition software used to distinguish PD from environmental \nnoise.  \n• Thresholds and Criteria:  \no PD magnitude should be below 50 pC in low -voltage UPS systems.  \no PD magnitude above 100 pC indicates insulation weakness or \ncontamination.",
