  "content": "Section 4.3: HOT WORK\n\nOBSERVATION:\nHot work  permit scheme is not adopted in the risk.  \n \nThe absence of a Hot Work Permit Scheme in the facility introduces significant fire and \nexplosion risks during hot work operations, such as welding, cutting, or the use of \nequipment that generates heat or naked flames. Among hazards from hot work activities \nare fire hazards, explosion and safety hazards.  \n \nFire Hazard  \n - Hot work generates sparks, heat, or open flames, which can easily ignite flammable \nmaterials, oils, gases, or dust present in the work area.  \nFires originating from hot work activities have been known to spread rapidly, causing \nextensive property damage and potential loss of life.  \n \nExplosion Risks:  \n - The presence of flammable vapours  or gases in poorly ventilated areas increases the \nlikelihood of explosions during hot work.  \n \nSafety Hazards:  \n - Lack of controls can lead to unsafe working conditions, putting employees and \ncontractors at significant risk of injury or fatalities.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nTo mitigate these risks and align with best practices, it is strongly recommended that the \ninsured adopt a formal Hot Work Permit System. This system is designed to establish \ncontrol measures for hot work activities, ensuring that potential hazards are identified and \nmitigated before, during, and after operations.  \n \nA formal Hot Work Permit System shall consider the followings key elements:  \n1. Permit Issuance Process  \no A hot work permit is a documented authorization that allows specific hot \nwork to be carried out in designated or temporary areas.  \no The permit is issued by a responsible authority, such as a safety officer or \nsupervisor, after assessing the risks and ensuring all safety precautions are \nin place.  \n2. Pre-Work Risk Assessment  \no Evaluate the work area for fire hazards, such as combustible materials, \nflammable liquids, and potential ignition sources.  \no Assess whether hot work can be avoided by using alternative methods \n(e.g., mechanical fasteners instead of welding).  \n3. Control Measures and Precautions  \no Fire Watch:  Assign a trained fire watch person to monitor the area during \nand after the work.  \no Isolation of Hazards:  Remove flammable materials or shield them with \nfire-resistant barriers.  \no Ventilation:  Ensure adequate ventilation to prevent the accumulation of \nflammable gases or vapours . \no Fire-Extinguishing Equipment:  Provide readily accessible fire \nextinguishers and other fire -suppression tools.  \no Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):  Workers should wear appropriate \nPPE, such as fire -resistant clothing, gloves, goggles, and helmets.  \n4. Documentation and Record -Keeping  \no Maintain a written record of all hot work permits issued, including the work location, time, nature of the work, and safety measures implemented.  \no The permit should also include details of the fire watch duration and post -\nwork inspection results.  \n5. Post -Work Inspection  \no Conduct a thorough inspection of the work area after the hot work is \ncompleted to ensure no residual heat, sparks, or smoldering materials \nremain.  \no Typically, a fire watch should continue for a specified duration (e.g., 30 -60 \nminutes) after the work ends.  \n6. Employee Training and Competence  \no Train all personnel involved in hot work activities and those responsible for \noverseeing the permit system.  \no Training should cover fire risks, control measures, the proper use of \nequipment, and emergency response protocols.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\nOccupational Safety and Health Act 1994 (OSHA 1994):  \n \nSection 15 - General Duties of Employers and Self -Employed Persons to Their \nEmployees:  \nEmployers are required to ensure, so far as is practicable, the safety, health, and welfare \nat work of all their employees.  \nThis includes providing and maintaining a safe working environment without risks to \nhealth, which encompasses controlling hazards associated with hot work activities.  \n \nSection 15: General Duties of Employers  \nThis section mandates employers to ensure the safety, health, and welfare of employees \nat work as far as is practicable. Implementing a Hot Work Permit System satisfies this duty \nby: \n \n4. Hazard Identification and Control:  \nThe permit system requires a comprehensive risk assessment to identify hazards \nassociated with hot work (e.g., sparks, open flames, and heat generation).  \nControl measures, such as removing flammable materials, providing fire extinguishers, \nand ensuring proper ventilation, mitigate risks before the work begins.  \n \n5. Safe Work Systems:  \nA Hot Work Permit System establishes a structured and documented process for \nmanaging hot work operations, ensuring safety protocols are consistently followed.  \n \nSection 16: Duty to Formulate a Safe Work System  \nEmployers are required to establish and maintain systems of work that are safe and \nwithout risks to health. A Hot Work Permit System fulfils  this requirement through:  \n \na) Pre-Work Authorization:  \nNo hot work activity can proceed without prior authorization from the designated safety \nofficer or Factory Manager, ensuring that all safety measures are in place.  \n \nb) Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):  \nThe system enforces SOPs for hot work activities, such as inspection of the work area, fire \nwatch assignments, and post -work monitoring.  \n \nSection 17: General Duties of Employers and Self -Employed Persons  \nThis section applies to ensuring the safety of non -employees (e.g., contractors, visitors) \naffected by workplace activities. A Hot Work Permit System ensures:  \n a) Control of Third -Party Activities:  \nContractors performing hot work must obtain permits and adhere to the same safety \nrequirements, ensuring a uniform standard across the workplace.  \n \nb) Minimization of Risks to Surrounding Areas:  \nThe permit system extends safety precautions to areas adjacent to hot work operations, \nreducing risks to non -participants.  \n \nc) Training and Awareness:  \nEmployers are obligated to provide training and resources to employees. The Hot Work \nPermit System includes educating workers and contractors on safe hot work practices and \nthe importance of obtaining permits.",
