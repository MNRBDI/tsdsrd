The frequent occurrence of lightning strikes \nincreases the likelihood of damage to critical equipment, power disruptions, and potential \nfire hazards. Furthermore, recent losses recorded due to lightning incidents highlight the \ninadequacy of current protection measures and the urgent need for improved lightning \nprotection systems.  \n \n \nLightning arestor and lightning strike counter\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\n1) Lightning Protection System (LPS) Installation:  \nImplement a comprehensive Lightning Protection System (LPS) designed to capture \nand safely dissipate lightning strikes. This should include:  \n• Air Terminals (Lightning Rods) strategically installed on all vulnerable structures.  \n• Down Conductors to provide a direct path for lightning current to reach the ground.  \n• Grounding Systems designed to effectively dissipate the electrical energy into the \nearth.  \n• Surge Protection Devices (SPDs) installed at all critical electrical and electronic \nequipment to protect against transient overvoltage.  \n•  \n2) Risk Assessment & Analysis:  \nConduct a detailed lightning risk assessment to determine the risk level associated \nwith lightning strikes at the site. This assessment should follow industry standards \nsuch as IEC 62305 or NFPA 780 and include factors such as structure size, location, \nand occupancy type.  \n \n3) Regular Maintenance & Inspection:  \nEstablish a routine inspection and maintenance program for the LPS and SPDs to \nensure their functionality and effectiveness. Regular testing of grounding resistance \nshould be performed and recorded.  \n \n4) Enhanced Monitoring Systems:  \nInstall real -time lightning monitoring and detection systems to provide early warning \nalerts. This will allow timely implementation of emergency procedures to safeguard \npersonnel and sensitive equipment.  \n \n5) Safety Procedures & Training:  Develop and implement safety procedures for personnel during lightning storms. \nProvide training on lightning safety, including protocols for seeking shelter, equipment \nshutdown, and response to lightning -related emergencies\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\nIn Malaysia, lightning protection system (LPS) design and related regulations are primarily \ngoverned by the MS IEC 62305  standard, which aligns with the international IEC 62305 \nstandard. This standard provides comprehensive guidelines on the design, installation, \nmaintenance, and testing of LPS to safeguard structures and their occupants from \nlightning -related hazards  \n \nPart 1: General Principles  \nThis section introduces the fundamental concepts of lightning protection, including \ndefinitions, lightning characteristics, and general protective measures.  \n \nPart 2: Risk Management  \nIt outlines methodologies for assessing the risk posed by lightning to structures and \nservices, helping determine the necessity and extent of protection measures required.  \n \nPart 3: Physical Damage to Structures and Life Hazard  \nThis part provides detailed guidance on protecting structures and individuals from physical \ndamage and injury due to lightning strikes. It covers the design considerations for external \nand internal LPS components.  \n \nPart 4: Electrical and Electronic Systems within Structures  \nIt focuses on safeguarding internal electrical and electronic systems from lightning -\ninduced surges, emphasizing the importance of surge protective devices and proper \nsystem design.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1.7 FALLING TREES  \nObservation  \nThe presence of large, mature trees within a developed area poses significant risks that \nmust be addressed to ensure safety and prevent potential losses. Trees provide essential \nbenefits such as shade, aesthetic value, and environmental enhancement. However, their \nsize, age, and structural condition can also pose hazards if not properly managed . This \nmay pose  to following risks:  \n \n1) Dead Trees:  \n• Trees that have died due to diseases, pest infestations (such as termites or \nbeetles), or natural decay are at a high risk of falling. Dead trees are structurally \nweak and can collapse suddenly, causing injury, property damage, or even \nfatalities.  \n \n2) Broken or Hanging Branches:  \n• Detached or partially broken branches, especially those hanging from significant \nheights, may fall unexpectedly. This can be hazardous to pedestrians, vehicles, \nand nearby structures.  \n \n3) Material Fall from Trees:  \n• Objects such as nests, fruits, or broken branches can fall without warning, posing a \nthreat to people and property below.  \n \n4) Signs of Disease or Structural Weakness:  \n• Presence of fungi, mushrooms, or perennial fruiting bodies on the trunk or \nbranches indicates internal decay and structural weakness.  \n• Disease symptoms such as leaf discoloration, premature shedding, or cankers can \nalso signal compromised health and stability.  \n \n5) Leaning Trees:  \n• Trees with a tilt greater than 10 degrees from the vertical pose a higher potential \nfor failure, especially during heavy rains, strong winds, or seismic activity.  \n \n6) Cracks in Trunks and Branches:  \n• Visible cracks are clear signs of compromised structural integrity, increasing the \nlikelihood of collapse during storms or high wind events.  \n \n7) Soil Heaving or Uplift:  \n• Disturbances around tree roots, such as soil heaving or uplift, indicate potential \nroot failure. Such trees may be ready to fall at any moment, particularly under \nadverse weather conditions  \n \nRecommendation  \n \nIt is advised that the participant examine, identify and appropriately maintain the trees by \neither pruning or eliminating the impacted trees in order to lessen the risks of a tree \ncollapsing. Following are among risk mitigation that could be done:  \n \n1) Tree Risk Assessment and Inspection:  \n• Regularly inspect all trees within the area, especially those located near high -traffic \nzones, parking lots, and structures.  \n• Engage certified arborists or tree risk assessment experts to evaluate tree health \nand structural integrity using standardized assessment tools.  \n \n2)  Pruning and Removal:  \n• Remove dead trees immediately to prevent accidental falls.  • Prune damaged or diseased branches to eliminate weak points and improve \noverall tree health.  \n• Implement preventive pruning to enhance structural stability and prevent the \nlikelihood of large branches breaking off during extreme weather conditions.  \n \n3) Disease Management:  \n• Monitor trees for signs of disease and take appropriate action to control or \neliminate the disease spread.  \n• Implement pest control measures where necessary to prevent infestations that \nmay compromise tree health.  \n \n4) Proactive Monitoring:  \n• Install monitoring devices where necessary to detect early signs of instability, such \nas tilting sensors or soil movement indicators.  \n \n5) Tree Support Systems:  \n• Where appropriate, install cabling, bracing, or guying systems to support \nstructurally weakened trees and minimize the risk of failure.  \n \nRegulation / Guideline  \n \n1) The Town and Country Planning Act 1976 (Act 172)  addresses the preservation \nand management of trees  under Part VA – Tree Preservation Order , particularly \nin Sections 35A to 35H . Here's a summary of the relevant parts  (35A and 35E) : \n \n1.1) Section 35A (Tree Preservation Order):  \n- The local planning authority can issue a tree preservation order if it's \nnecessary to preserve trees for amenity purposes.  \n- The order can prohibit the felling of trees with out written permission from \nthe local planning authority.  \n- It can also require the planting or replanting of trees as directed by the \nauthority.  \nExemptions include trees that are dying, dead, or present an imminent \ndanger  \n \n1.2) Section 35E (Replacement of trees ): \n- Any person found guilty of unauthorized felling must replace the tree with \nanother of appropriate size and species at a specified location  \n \n \n2) Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994 (OSHA):  \nWhile not exclusively focused on tree management, OSHA mandates that employers \nensure the safety, health, and welfare of their workers. This includes implementing \nsafety measures during tree maintenance activities, such as pruning or removal, to \nprotect workers from potential hazards",
