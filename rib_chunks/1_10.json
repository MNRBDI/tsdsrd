  "content": "Section 1.10: ENHANCING IMPACT PROTECTION FOR NATURAL GAS REDUCING \nAND METERING STATION\n\nOBSERVATION:\nThe natural gas reducing and metering station is located within a yard that also serves as \na car parking area. It is protected by a chain -link fence and plastic impact barriers \npositioned along the side most exposed to vehicle traffic from the parking bays. However, \nthe current use of plastic barriers is considered inadequate to prevent significant vehicle \nimpact, especially from larger vehicles or high -speed collisions. If compromised, this \nstation poses a severe risk of natural gas leaks, explosions, and subsequent fire hazards.  \n \nThe hazard identified from this are as follows:  \n- Potential impact damage from vehicles due to inadequate barrier strength.  \n- Risk of gas leaks from damaged piping or control systems following a vehicle \ncollision.  \n- Increased likelihood of ignition sources in case of gas leaks due to the proximity of \nvehicles.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nTo mitigate the risks associated with impact damage, the following measures are strongly \nrecommended:  \n \n1. Replace Plastic Impact Barriers with Reinforced Concrete Barriers:  \n• Install reinforced concrete impact barriers permanently along the side of the \nnatural gas reducing and metering station that is exposed to the car parking bays.  \n• Ensure that the barriers are constructed to withstand high -impact forces, providing \nrobust protection against accidental vehicle collisions.  \n• The design should adhere to relevant standards, ensuring barriers are tall and \nwide enough to provide effective coverage  \n \n2. Enhanced Perimeter Protection:  \n• In addition to concrete barriers, consider enhancing the chain -link fence with \nimpact -resistant guardrails or steel bollards for added security.  \n• The installation should cover all sides that may be exposed to vehicle movement, \nnot just the most vulnerable side  \n \n3. Improved Signage and Markings:  \n• Clearly mark the protected area with warning signs and reflective markings to \nenhance visibility for drivers.  \n• Install speed limit signs within the parking area to reduce the likelihood of high -\nspeed collisions\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\n1. Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994 (OSHA 1994):  \n• Employers must provide a safe working environment by identifying and mitigating \npotential hazards, including impact damage to critical installations.  \n• This includes implementing appropriate physical barriers to protect gas stations \nfrom accidental impact.  \n \n2. Gas Supply Act 1993 (Act 501) (38)(f):  \n• Govern the measures to be taken and the equipment to be supplied and used in \nconnection with pipelines and installations in order to secure public and private \nsafety;   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nElectrical",
