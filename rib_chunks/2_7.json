However, we noted that the kill \nswitch is not locked, which could allow unauthorized personnel to access it.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nThe kill switch for each individual shop unit is located at the rear of the unit. It is installed \nto cut off the power supply to each unit and is turned off after operating hours, typically \nbetween 11 pm and 12 am every day by the insured personnel stationed at the site. \nHowever, the kill switch is not properly locked, which could allow unauthorized access.  \nWe recommend that the kill switch be properly locked to prevent unauthorized access. \nAlternatively, the kill switch can be installed in a centralized location within a single \nenclosure and securely locked, as implemented at the Shah Alam branch (refer photo \nbelow).\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\nNot applicable  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHOUSEKEEPING",
