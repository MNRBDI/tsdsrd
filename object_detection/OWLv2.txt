     sepatutnya RIB 2.3 instead of 3.8

/home/amir/Desktop/MRE TSD/RIB_images/page30_img2.png

pun sama jugak recommend 3.8 instead of 2.3

page 32 1&2 both betul

page 34 1, recommend subsidence. actual is exposed wiring

/home/amir/Desktop/MRE TSD/RIB_images/page36_img1.png, detect 2.4 which is wrong. correct should be 2.6 burn mark at circuit breaker

page 38, recommend 2.4 (electrical board not closed) but it should be 2.7 (kill switch)

page 44, recommend 1.2 (pipe bursting) but it should be 3.3 (storage of lpg gas cylinder)
