  "content": "Section 3.4: STORAGE OF LIQUID DRUMS WITHOUT CONTAINMENT\n\nOBSERVATION:\nThere are metal drums containing liquids (unknown liquid) being stored inside the chiller \nplant. These storage drums present potential risks related to chemical spills, leaks and \ncontamination, which could lead to safety hazards, environmental harm and operational \ndisruption.  \n \nor  \n \nThe presence of metal drums containing unknown liquids inside the chiller plant presents \nseveral potential hazards, including:  \n \nChemical spills & leaks – leading to environmental contamination and workplace \nexposure.  \nFire & explosion risk – if flammable or reactive substances are stored improperly.  \nHealth hazards – exposure to hazardous chemicals due to vapor release or direct contact.  \nOperational disruption – spills or leaks can damage surrounding equipment and cause \nsystem downtime  \n \n \nMetal drums  storage\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nTo address the risk associated with drum storage, effective spill containment measures \nare essential to prevent leaks or spills from causing safety hazards. The following steps \nshould be implemented to ensure robust spill containment.  \n \n1) Use of Spill Containment Systems  \n• Chemical drums should be stored on spill containment trays or secondary \ncontainment pallets specifically designed to capture and contain any leaks, spills, or \noverflows. These systems provide a physical barrier that prevents hazardous substances \nfrom spreading to the surrounding environment.  \n• Each containment unit must have the capacity to hold at least 110% of the largest \ndrum's volume stored on it, ensuring sufficient space for potential leaks, even in the event \nof a complete drum failure.  \n   \n2) Compatibility of Containment Materials  \n• The materials used in spill containment trays or pallets must be chemically \ncompatible with the substances being stored. For example:  \no Polyethylene pallets should be used for most corrosive chemicals, such as acids \nand bases, as they are resistant to corrosion.  \no Steel containment systems may be suitable for non -corrosive flammable liquids but \nshould not be used for acids or other corrosive substances, as this can lead to material \ndegradation.  \n• Conduct regular assessments of the compatibility between the containment \nsystems and stored chemicals to ensure long -term effectiveness.  \n \n3) Containment System Features  \n• Ensure the containment systems are equipped with raised edges or grates to keep \nthe drums elevated, preventing contact with leaked liquids and reducing the risk of further \ncorrosion or damage to the drums.  \n• Install drainage plugs or ports on the containment units to allow for safe removal of \nspilled liquids for proper disposal, in compliance with hazardous waste\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\n1. OSHA 29 CFR 1910.106(e)(2)(iii) (U.S.) – Secondary Containment for Hazardous \nSubstances  \n \nSeparation and protection. Areas in which flammable liquids are transferred from one \ntank or container to another container shall be separated from other operations in the \nbuilding by adequate distance or by construction having adequate fire resistance. \nDrainage or other means shall be provided to control spills. Adequate natural or \nmechanical ventilation shall be provided.  \n \nKey Requirement:  \n \n• Requires secondary containment systems for hazardous substances.  \n• The containment system must hold at least 110% of the volume of the largest \nstored drum.  \n• Applicable to facilities handling flammable and combustible liquids.  \n \nRecommended Implementation:  \n• Install secondary containment pallets or bunded storage for all hazardous \nsubstances.  \n• Conduct routine inspections to ensure containment integrity and capacity \ncompliance.  \n• Ensure employees are trained on proper storage, handling, and spill response.  \n \n \n2. NFPA 30 (Flammable & Combustible Liquids Code) – Fire Safety for Liquid \nStorage  \n \nChapter 9: Addresses the storage of liquids in containers, including design and \nconstruction of storage cabinets, storage arrangements, and maximum allowable \nquantities  \n \nChapter 12: Focuses on the storage of liquids in containers and portable tanks within \nstorage areas, detailing design and construction requirements for liquid storage rooms \nand warehouses.  \n \nChapter 15: Covers the storage of liquids in tanks, specifying requirements for both aboveground and underground storage tanks, including design, construction, and \ninstallation.  \n \nKey Requirement:  \n \n• Ensures flammable and combustible liquids are stored and handled safely to \nprevent fire hazards.  \n• Requires fire -rated storage cabinets and spill containment systems.  \n• Storage areas must maintain a minimum separation distance from ignition \nsources.  \n \nRecommended Implementation:  \n• Store flammable liquids in NFPA -approved fire -rated cabinets.  \n• Maintain minimum fire separation distances between storage areas and \nmachinery.  \n• Install automatic fire suppression systems in high -risk zones.  \n  \n \n 3.5 CONTAINMENT / CATCH PIT / OUTLET DISCHARGE CONTAINMENT  \nObservation  \nThe outlet discharge for the metal drums storing diesel has not been equipped with a \ncontainment system, posing a significant risk of spillage. Diesel is a flammable liquid, and \nspillage could lead to environmental contamination, fire hazards, and non -compliance with \nsafety regulations.  \n \nRecommendation  \nTo mitigate this risk, the following measures are strongly recommended:  \n \nInstall Containment for Outlet Discharge:  \nA containment system, such as a drip tray, spill pallet, or bunded platform, should be \ninstalled beneath the outlet discharge to capture any accidental leaks or spills.  \nThe containment system should be made of non -reactive, fire -resistant materials and \nsized to hold at least 110% of the maximum capacity of the largest drum in the area.  \n \nSpill Prevention Accessories:  \nEquip the outlet discharge with self -closing valves or nozzles to prevent uncontrolled flow \nof diesel during transfer operations.  \n \nRegular Inspection and Maintenance:  \nImplement a routine inspection program to ensure the containment system is in good \ncondition and free of blockages or damage.  \n \nCompliance with Regulations:  \nEnsure the containment system meets the requirements of local environmental and fire \nsafety regulations, such as NFPA 30 (Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code) or \nequivalent standards.  \nRegulation / Guideline  \nRegulations for Containment of Metal Drums Containing Diesel  \n \n1.  National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Standards  \nNFPA 30 (Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code):  \nRequires spill containment systems for flammable liquids, such as diesel.  \nContainment must have sufficient capacity to handle at least 110% of the volume of the \nlargest container or as specified by local regulations.  \nProhibits uncontrolled discharge of flammable liquids to reduce fire hazards.  \n \n2. Occupational Safety Standards  OSHA 29 CFR 1910.106 (Flammable Liquids):  \n \nOSHA 29 CFR 1910.106(e)(2)(iii)  \nSeparation and protection. Areas in which flammable liquids are transferred from one tank \nor container to another container shall be separated from other operations in the building \nby adequate distance or by construction having adequate fire resistance. Drainage or \nother means shall be provided to control spills. Adequate natural or mechanical ventilation \nshall be provided.  \n \nRequires proper storage and handling of flammable liquids, including diesel.  \nSecondary containment systems must be provided to contain leaks or spills during \ntransfer or storage.",
