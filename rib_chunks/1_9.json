  "content": "Section 1.9: IMPACT DAMAGE FROM LIFTING ACTIVITIES\n\nOBSERVATION:\nThere is evidence of impact damage to the walls and roof of the factory resulting from \nlifting activities carried out by lorries and other large vehicles. These damages may occur \ndue to poor manoeuvring , inadequate clearance, or improper handling of heavy materials \nduring loading and unloading operations.  \n \nThe continued occurrence of such incidents could result in structural damage, \ncompromising the integrity of the building and potentially causing safety hazards to \npersonnel and equipment within the factory premises.  \n \nThe risk assessment on caused of damage and potential consequences from this kind of \nrisk/hazard shall be carried out as follows.  \n \n1. Causes of Damage:  \no Inadequate clearance between vehicles and factory walls/roof during lifting \noperations.  \no Poorly designed loading/unloading areas that do not account for the size and \nheight of lorries and large vehicles.  \no Insufficient guidance systems or markings for safe manoeuvring . \no Lack of proper training for vehicle operators on safe lifting and maneuvering \nprocedures.  \no Absence of barriers or protective structures to prevent accidental impact.  \n \n2. Potential Consequences:  \no Structural damage to the factory’s walls and roof, leading to expensive repairs \nor reconstruction.  \no Increased risk of injury to workers and visitors due to falling debris or \ncompromised structures.  \no Disruption of operations and potential downtime if critical areas are damaged.  \no Insurance claims or increased premiums due to repeated incidents of damage.  \no Loss of reputation and credibility for failing to implement adequate safety \nmeasures.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nTo mitigate the risks associated with impact damage, the following measures are strongly \nrecommended:  \n \n1. Physical Barriers and Protective Structures:  \n• Install protective barriers, bollards, or railings at strategic points to prevent vehicles \nfrom making direct contact with factory walls and roofs.  \n• Construct roof guards or height restrictors where applicable, especially where \nvehicles may inadvertently hit overhead structures.  \n \n2. Clear Markings and Guidance Systems:  \n• Mark all loading/unloading zones with high -visibility paint or reflective tape to \ndelineate safe paths for vehicles.  \n• Install warning signs and height restriction indicators to alert drivers to potential \ncollision points.  \n• Consider installing mirrors or visual aids to enhance visibility for drivers when \nmanoeuvring  in tight spaces.  \n \n3. Improved Loading/Unloading Area Design:  • Review and redesign the layout of loading/unloading areas to ensure sufficient \nclearance for lorries and other large vehicles.  \n• Provide dedicated zones for lifting activities, separated from pedestrian pathways \nand vulnerable structures.  \n \n4. Operator Training and Safe Operating Procedures:  \n• Implement regular training programs for vehicle operators focusing on safe lifting \nand manoeuvring  procedures.  \n• Provide training on proper vehicle positioning, safe speed limits, and lifting \ntechniques to minimize the risk of impact.  \n \nBy implementing these recommendations, the risk of structural damage from lifting \nactivities by lorries and large vehicles can be significantly reduced. Enhanced safety \nmeasures will protect both the physical infrastructure of the factory and the safety of \npersonnel, ultimately resulting in cost savings and improved operational efficiency.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\nSafety and Health Act 1994 (OSHA 1994)  \n \nSection 15: General Duties of Employers  \n- Employers are required to ensure, as far as is practicable, the safety, health, and \nwelfare at work of all their employees.  \n \nNote: This includes providing and maintaining a safe working environment and \nensuring that plant and machinery are safe and without health risks.  \n \nSection 24: General Duties of Employee  \n- to take reasonable care for the safety and health of himself  and of other persons \nwho may be affected by his acts or  omissions at work . \n \nNote: Employees are obligated to take reasonable care for their own safety and health, \nas well as that of others who may be affected by their actions at work. They must also \ncooperate with their employers in adhering to safety and health regulations",
