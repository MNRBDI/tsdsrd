  "content": "Section 5.15: CORROSION OF UNDERWATER BRIDGE PILINGS\n\nOBSERVATION:\nA bridge located in a coastal area has been in operation for over 10 years. During a \nroutine underwater inspection, divers discovered signs of corrosion on the steel pilings, \nparticularly around the splash zone and at the welded joints. Ultrasonic thickness testing \nrevealed a 20% reduction in wall thickness, indicating progressive corrosion due to \nconstant exposure to saltwater and marine organisms. Some areas showed visible rust \nand pitting, raising concerns about the structural integrity of the bridge .\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nProper maintenance of underwater pilings is crucial to ensure the long -term structural \nintegrity and safety of the bridge, especially in a coastal environment where exposure to \nsaltwater accelerates corrosion. The discovery of corrosion around the splash zone and \nwelded joints indicates that protective measures are either insufficient or have deteriorated \nover time.  \n \nIt is recommended to apply an epoxy -based anti -corrosion coating to the affected areas to \nprovide a protective barrier against saltwater exposure. Installing sacrificial anodes and an \nimpressed current cathodic protection (ICCP) system can further prevent corrosion by \nredirecting corrosive currents away from the steel surface. Additionally, regular underwater \ninspections using remote -operated vehicles (ROVs) and ultrasonic testing should be \nscheduled every 2 to 3 years to monitor the condition of the pilings and assess the \neffectiveness of the protection systems. Proper maintenance not only extends the service \nlife of the bridge but also reduces the risk of structural failure, ensuring the safety of users \nand minimizing costly repairs.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\n1. Standard Specification for Road Works - Section 10: Piling Works (JKR)  \n• This standard specifies the requirements for the supply, installation, and testing of \npiling works for road and bridge construction in Malaysia.  \n• While it mainly focuses on the design and installation of piles, it includes important \nguidelines for material selection and protection against environmental degradation, \nincluding corrosion.  \n \nKey Provisions:  \n• Material Requirements:  \no Piling materials must comply with specified strength, durability, and \ncorrosion resistance.  \no Common materials include reinforced concrete, steel, and composite \nmaterials.  \n• Protection Measures:  \no Protective coatings and cathodic protection systems (especially for steel \npiles) are recommended to reduce corrosion risks.  \no Anti-corrosion coatings must comply with recognized international coating \nstandards (e.g., ISO or ASTM).  \n• Testing and Inspection:  \no Piles must be tested using Non -Destructive Testing (NDT) methods such \nas: \n▪ Ultrasonic Testing (UT)  \n▪ Magnetic Particle Testing (MT)  \n▪ Radiographic Testing (RT)  \no Regular underwater inspections are advised to identify early signs of corrosion and structural degradation.  \n• Remedial Measures:  \no If corrosion is detected, protective measures such as epoxy coating, \nsacrificial anodes, or impressed current cathodic protection (ICCP) should \nbe applied.  \n \n2. API RP 2SIM – Structural Integrity Management of Fixed Offshore Structures  \n• This recommended practice provides a comprehensive framework for the \nstructural integrity management of fixed offshore structures, including submerged \nand underwater piling systems.  \n• It focuses on the use of a Risk -Based Inspection (RBI) strategy to prioritize \ninspections and maintenance efforts based on structural risk levels.  \n \nKey Provisions:  \n• Design Life Consideration:  \no The inspection program should align with the original design life of the \npiling structure.  \no Corrosion risk is assessed based on material properties, environmental \nexposure, and loading conditions.  \n• Inspection Planning:  \no Defines different levels of inspection based on risk:  \n▪ General Visual Inspection (GVI): Routine inspection to check for \nsurface -level corrosion.  \n▪ Close Visual Inspection (CVI): Detailed assessment using divers or \nremotely operated vehicles (ROVs).  \n▪ Non-Destructive Testing (NDT): Use of ultrasonic or acoustic \nmethods to measure wall thickness and detect internal corrosion.  \n• Data Analysis and Integrity Assessment:  \no Data from inspections should be analysed to determine the remaining \nservice life of the structure.  \no Corrosion rates should be calculated to predict the time frame for potential \nfailure.  \n• Remedial Actions:  \no Application of corrosion protection methods:  \n▪ Sacrificial anodes  \n▪ Coatings  \n▪ ICCP systems  \n \n3. API RP 2A – Recommended Practice for Planning, Designing, and Constructing \nFixed Offshore Platforms  \n• API RP 2A is widely used for offshore platforms and is applicable to bridge pilings \nin marine environments.  \n• It emphasizes the impact of marine exposure, including corrosion from saltwater \nand environmental loading.  \n \nKey Provisions:  \n• Design and Material Selection:  \no Steel and concrete materials should be selected based on resistance to \nmarine corrosion.  \no Coatings and sealants must meet offshore durability standards.  \n• Inspection Procedures:  \no Underwater visual and NDT inspections should be conducted at regular \nintervals.  \no Specific focus on welded joints, splash zones, and high -stress areas.  \n• Corrosion Allowance:  o Minimum thickness requirements should account for anticipated corrosion \nloss over the design life.  \no Cathodic protection systems should be designed to last for the intended \nservice life of the structure.  \n• Repair and Protection:  \no Epoxy coatings and anode replacement should be planned as part of long -\nterm maintenance.  \n \n4. ISO 19902 – Fixed Steel Offshore Structures  \n• This standard provides technical guidelines for the design, construction, \nmaintenance, and inspection of fixed steel offshore structures, including bridge \npilings.  \nKey Provisions:  \n• Corrosion Assessment:  \no Structural analysis should incorporate corrosion loss rates based on \nenvironmental exposure.  \no Protective coatings should be applied to surfaces exposed to seawater.  \n• Inspection Methods:  \no Use of Remote Operated Vehicles (ROVs) for underwater inspection.  \no Acoustic and ultrasonic inspection to assess wall thickness and internal \ncorrosion.  \n• Maintenance Strategy:  \no Corrosion protection using sacrificial anodes and ICCP systems.  \no Regular replacement of protective elements based on inspection results.  \n• Structural Monitoring:  \no Installation of monitoring systems to measure corrosion rates and stress \nlevels over time.  \n \n5. Risk -Based Underwater Inspection (RBUI) – PETRONAS Carigali Sdn Bhd (PCSB)  \n• PETRONAS developed RBUI as part of its Structural Integrity Management \nSystem (SIMS) for managing offshore structures.  \n• The RBUI approach applies to underwater bridge piling inspections in similar \nenvironmental conditions.  \n \nKey Provisions:  \n• Risk-Based Strategy:  \no Prioritize inspection based on the probability of failure and consequences.  \no High-risk areas (e.g., splash zones, joints) require more frequent \ninspections.  \n• Corrosion Monitoring:  \no Corrosion rates should be monitored continuously using acoustic and \nultrasonic sensors.  \no Historical data should be analyzed to predict long -term corrosion impact.  \n• Maintenance Recommendations:  \no Proactive anode replacement and coating repairs based on inspection \nfindings.  \no Real-time monitoring to assess ongoing structural health.  \n \n6. JKR and Malaysian Institute of Road Safety Research (MIROS) – Guidelines for \nBridge Inspection and Maintenance  \n• Provides general guidelines for the maintenance and inspection of bridges in \nMalaysia, including underwater pilings.  \nKey Provisions:  \n• Inspection Intervals:  \no Routine inspection – every 1 to 2 years  o Detailed underwater inspection – every 5 years  \n• Assessment Methods:  \no Visual inspection (using divers or ROVs)  \no Ultrasonic thickness measurement  \no Acoustic emission testing  \n• Documentation:  \no All findings should be recorded in a central database.  \no Digital models should be used to track long -term degradation.  \n• Maintenance Strategies:  \no Apply protective coatings based on environmental exposure.  \no Install sacrificial anodes and ICCP systems in high -risk areas .",
