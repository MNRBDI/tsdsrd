  "content": "Section 4.9: PROPOSAL OF PATROL CLOCKING\n\nOBSERVATION:\nThere is no patrol clocking system be adopted in the premises.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nTo enhance the security and safety standards of the premises, it is strongly recommended \nthat a patrol clocking system be adopted. This system involves the installation of patrol \nclocking points at strategic locations along the premises' perimeter and other high -risk \nareas. These points should be carefully selected to ensure comprehensive coverage of \nthe property, facilitating regular and systematic patrols by security personnel.  \n \nPurpose and Benefits:  \n- Enhanced Monitoring: The patrol clocking system ensures that security guards \npatrol designated areas at scheduled intervals, particularly during vulnerable \nperiods such as nighttime, minimizing security lapses.  \n- Deterrence of Unauthorized Activities: Visible and consistent patrols serve as a \ndeterrent against unauthorized access, theft, vandalism, and other illicit activities.  \n- Early Detection of Risks: By conducting systematic patrols, security personnel are \nmore likely to identify and respond promptly to signs of unauthorized entry, fire \nhazards, equipment malfunctions, or other irregularities.  \n- Accountability and Compliance: The system provides documented proof of patrols, \nensuring accountability and adherence to security protocols.  \n \nRisk Mitigation:  \nThis proactive measure helps mitigate risks related to:  \n - Security breaches: Unauthorized access to sensitive or restricted areas.  \n - Fire safety lapses: Early identification of fire risks, such as unsecured electrical \nappliances or combustible materials.  \n - Operational disruptions: Prevention of sabotage or tampering with critical systems or \ninfrastructure.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\nThe implementation of a patrol clocking system aligns with Occupational Safety and \nHealth Act 1994 (OSHA 1994), particularly under Section 15, which mandates employers \nto ensure a safe working environment for all employees.  \n \nDetails of Section 15 of the Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994 (OSHA 1994):  \n \nSection 15 of OSHA 1994 outlines the general duties of employers and self -employed \npersons to their employees. This section mandates employers to ensure, so far as is \npracticable, the safety, health, and welfare of all employees while at work. The specific \nprovisions under Section 15 include:  \n \nProvision of a Safe Work Environment (Section 15(2)(a)):  \nEmployers are required to ensure that the working environment is free from risks to health \nand safety.  \nNote: The implementation of a patrol clocking system contributes to this by minimizing \nrisks such as unauthorized entry, fire hazards, and other security threats that could \njeopardize employee safety.  \n \nSafe Systems of Work (Section 15(2)(b)):  \nEmployers must ensure that safe work systems are implemented.  \nNote: A patrol clocking system formalizes the security patrol process, creating a \nsystematic approach to monitoring and addressing risks.   \nProvision of Necessary Information, Instruction, Training, and Supervision (Section \n15(2)(c)):  \nEmployers must provide employees, including security personnel, with the necessary \ntraining and supervision to carry out their duties safely. Training security staff to use the \npatrol clocking system ensures they understand the risks, procedures, and actions \nrequired to maintain workplace safety.  \n \nMaintenance of Facilities (Section 15(2)(d)):  \nEmployers are responsible for maintaining the premises and any equipment used to \nensure safety and health. Installing and maintaining a patrol clocking system aligns with \nthis obligation, as it requires regular checks and upkeep to ensure its effectiveness.  \n \nHealth and Safety Policy (Section 15(2)(e)):  \nEmployers must establish and update policies that address safety and health risks. The \nintroduction of a patrol clocking system can be integrated into the organization's security \nand safety policy, demonstrating compliance with this requirement.  \n \nApplication of Section 15 in Relation to Patrol Clocking Systems:  \nBy adopting a patrol clocking system, employers actively fulfil their responsibilities under  \nSection 15 by:  \n \n- Creating a safer environment that proactively addresses risks to health and safety.  \n- Ensuring systematic supervision and monitoring to prevent incidents.  \n- Providing a structured process for the identification and mitigation of hazards, \nparticularly during high -risk periods such as nighttime.  \n- The patrol clocking system thus supports the overarching goal of Section 15 to \nensure the safety, health, and welfare of employees and aligns with the legislative \nframework designed to uphold workplace safety in Malaysia   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPRO CESS",
