  "content": "Section 2.5: EXPOSED WIRING\n\nOBSERVATION:\nIt is observed that there is a lot of exposed wiring in the showroom.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nAll exposed wires pose an electrical safety hazard, but exposed wiring within the structure \nof the building is of particular concern because it represents a hidden danger. When \nexposed wiring occurs in the structure of a building, it can easily be in close proximity to \nflammable materials, posing an increased risk of an electrical fire.  \n \nFires caused by exposed wires can spread rapidly, especially if they occur in enclosed \nspaces or areas with a high concentration of flammable materials. It is essential to \nunderstand that even a small spark from an exposed wire can quickly escalate into a full -\nblown fire. This is because the heat generated by the spark can ignite nearby materials, \nand the resulting fire can be fuelled by the electricity flowing through the wire. Therefore, it \nis crucial to address exposed wires promptly to prevent fire hazards.  \n \nTo ensure safety, it’s essential to properly cover any exposed wiring with electrical \ninsulation or enclosures to avoid accidental contact. All wiring connections must be \nprovided with an approved junction box, especially for connections that are intended to be \nmade later.  \n \nSample of approved junction box as below.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\nSuruhanjaya Tenaga (Energy Commission of Malaysia)  and Malaysian Standards \n(MS)  provide guidelines and regulations to ensure electrical safety and standards in various electrical installations, including for exposed wiring. These regulations cover \nvarious aspects such as wiring installation, safety measures, equipment, and inspection \nprocedures to ensure the safety of users and to minimize the risks associated with \nelectrical hazards.  \n \n1. MS 1933: 2015 – Code of Practice for the Electrical Wiring of Buildings  \n• General Wiring Safety: MS 1933 outlines the minimum requirements for the \ndesign, installation, and maintenance of electrical wiring in buildings. This includes \nguidelines for exposed wiring, which should be installed in such a way as to \nprevent electrical hazards and allow for future maintenance.  \n• Exposed Wiring Requirements: The standard includes specific requirements \nregarding exposed wiring in different areas of buildings. Wiring should be protected \nby conduits or enclosures, particularly in areas that are more prone to physical \ndamage. For example:  \no Indoor wiring should be securely fastened and protected with conduit if \nexposed.  \no Outdoor or external wiring should use weather -resistant materials and be \nenclosed in durable conduit to protect against the elements.  \n• Fire Safety Measures: Wiring systems must be installed with consideration to fire \nsafety. Exposed wiring should be insulated and installed in a way that minimizes \nthe risk of overheating or sparking, especially near combustible materials.  \n• Electrical Equipment Enclosures: MS 1933 also specifies that electrical equipment, \nsuch as junction boxes, must be securely mounted and properly enclosed to avoid \nelectrical shock hazards.  \n \n2. MS IEC 60364 – Electrical Installations of Buildings  \nThis is an internationally recognized standard that has been adapted into Malaysian \nstandards, which outlines the general rules for the electrical installations in buildings.  \n• Wiring Systems: Exposed wiring should be installed according to the proper \nclassifications. For example, Class I, II, and III protection methods may be used \ndepending on the environment.  \n• Fire Hazard Prevention: The standard emphasizes the need to minimize fire \nhazards by using correct cable types, ensuring adequate grounding, and securing \ncables away from flammable materials.  \n \n3. Suruhanjaya Tenaga (Energy Commission) Guidelines – Guidelines for \nElectrical Installations (GEI)  \nThe GEI is based on and is a part of the Electricity Supply Act 1990 and the Electricity \nRegulations 1994. These pieces of legislation set out the legal framework within which \nelectrical installations in Malaysia must be carried out. The GEI sets the requirements for \nsafe electrical installations in buildings, ensuring that electrical wiring is installed, \nmaintained, and used in a way that prevents risks such as electrical fires or electric \nshocks.  \n• Exposed Wiring and Safety: The Energy Commission mandates that exposed \nwiring should be properly insulated and protected, using appropriate conduits and \nenclosures, to prevent accidental contact, damage, or fire.  \n• Risk Mitigation: Installations must be carried out by qualified electricians, and all \nwork must meet prescribed safety standards. Exposed wiring should be minimized \nor covered wherever possible to reduce the risk of fire or shock.  \n• Regulation on Overhead and Underground Wiring  \nThe Energy Commission provides specific guidelines on overhead and \nunderground wiring installations. Exposed wiring should be properly secured and \nprotected to avoid environmental damage, especially in high -risk areas where \nthere could be exposure to physical damage, moisture, or other hazards.",
