  "content": "Section 4.7: SMOKING POLICY NOT ENFORCED\n\nOBSERVATION:\nSmoking has been identified as one of the top ten sources of ignition, making it a leading \ncause of fires globally. This risk becomes significantly heightened in high -hazard areas \nwhere flammable liquids, gases, or large quantities of combustible materials are stored or \nprocessed. Carelessly discarded cigarettes, matches, or smoking materials can smolder \nundetected, often leading to fully developed fires that can cause extensive damage before \nbeing discovered.  \n \nTo address this risk effectively and align with regulatory and industry standards, it is \nessential to implement and enforce a robust smoking policy.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nTo mitigate the risks associated with smoking, the following measures are strongly \nrecommended:  \n \n1. Smoking Prohibition in High -Risk Areas  \nSmoking should be strictly prohibited in all areas of the facility where flammable or \ncombustible materials are present, including:  \n- Storage areas for flammable liquids and gases.  \n- Processing zones handling combustible materials.  \n- Warehouses, laboratories, and confined spaces where fire hazards exist.  \n \n2. Development of a Comprehensive Smoking Policy  \nEstablish a formal smoking policy that clearly defines:  \n- Areas where smoking is prohibited.  \n- The location and management of designated smoking areas (if applicable).  \n- Enforcement measures for non -compliance.  \n- Ensure the policy includes basic smoking safeguards such as proper disposal \nmethods for smoking materials (e.g., fire -safe receptacles).  \n \n3. Effective Communication of the Smoking Policy  \nThe smoking policy should be communicated effectively to all levels of employees, \ncontractors, visitors, and other stakeholders. This can be achieved through:  \n- Safety briefings and orientations.  \n- Signage and written materials.  \n- Digital communication platforms (e.g., emails, intranet postings).  \n- Special attention should be given to ensuring language and literacy considerations \nare addressed so the policy is clearly understood by all.  \n \n4. Provision of Clear and Visible Signage  \nInstall prominent and visible signage at strategic locations within the facility, including:  \n- Entrances, exits, and common areas.  \n- High-hazard zones.  \n- Designated smoking areas (if applicable).  \n- Examples of signage include:  \n- “Strictly No Smoking\" signs for prohibited areas.  \n- \"Designated Smoking Area\" signs for controlled smoking zones.  \n \n5. Designation of Safe Smoking Areas (If Smoking is Permitted)  \nDesignate specific areas for smoking that are:  \n- Located a safe distance from high -risk zones.  \n- Equipped with fire -safe ashtrays or receptacles for proper disposal of cigarette \nbutts and matches.  \n- Clearly marked and easily accessible.   \n6. Regular Monitoring and Enforcement  \n- Conduct regular inspections to ensure compliance with the smoking policy.  \n- Assign personnel (e.g., safety officers or supervisors) to monitor adherence and address \nviolations promptly.  \n- Establish and communicate penalties for non -compliance to deter breaches of the policy.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\n1. NFPA Standards (National Fire Protection Association)  \n \nNFPA 101: Life Safety Code mandates fire safety measures, including smoking \nrestrictions, in various facilities.  \nNFPA 10: Standard for Portable Fire Extinguishers emphasizes the importance of \nreducing ignition sources such as smoking in fire -prone zones.  \n \n2. OSHA 1994  \n \n1. General Duties of Employers  \nUnder Section 15 of OSHA 1994, employers are required to:  \n- Ensure, so far as is practicable, the safety, health, and welfare of employees at \nwork.  \n- Provide a safe working environment, which includes controlling fire hazards like \nsmoking in high -risk areas.  \n \nApplication to Smoking Policy:  \n- Smoking poses fire risks, especially in workplaces with flammable substances or \nmaterials.  \n- Employers must establish and enforce a smoking policy to eliminate or minimize \nthis risk.  \n- They are also responsible for ensuring that all employees are informed about the \nsmoking restrictions.  \n \n2. Control of Workplace Hazards  \nUnder Section 16 of OSHA 1994, employers must formulate and implement a safety and \nhealth policy. This includes addressing workplace hazards like smoking.  \n \nApplication to Smoking Policy:  \n- The smoking policy should be part of the overall safety and health policy.  \n- It should identify areas where smoking is prohibited, such as:  \n- Storage areas for flammable materials.  \n- Areas with high concentrations of combustible materials.  \n- Employers must also implement measures like signage, designated smoking areas \n(if allowed), and fire -safe disposal receptacles.",
