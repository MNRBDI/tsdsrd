It will assist \nrisk engineers in enhancing their knowledge of risk improvements and serve as a \ndepartmental database. Additionally, it offers clear guidance on meeting regulatory, legal, \nand industry -specific safety standards, ensuring that the risk improvements provided to \nclients, help them avoid non -compliance penalties.  \n \nThese RIB however are not final i.e. can still be subjected to change by risk engineers / \nsurveyor to meet the suitability of the actual recommendations.  Any new recommendations \nare more than welcomed.",
