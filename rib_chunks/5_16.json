  "content": "Section 5.16: STATIC ELECTRICITY DURING THE UNWINDING AND WINDING OF \nPLASTIC SHEETS\n\nOBSERVATION:\nA rotogravure printing machine in a plastic packaging factory has been operating for \nseveral years without an electrostatic eliminator. The machine prints high -speed plastic \nfilm rolls used for food packaging. During the printing process, the plastic film unwinds and \npasses over multiple rollers at high speeds, creating friction between the rollers and the \nplastic surface. This friction generates a significant buildup of static electricity on the \nplastic film surface\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nManaging static electricity during the unwinding and winding of plastic sheets is essential \nto ensure product quality, operational efficiency, and safety. Static charges accumulate \ndue to friction, separation, and contact with machine components, leading to issues such \nas dust attraction, material misalignment, o perator shocks, and potential fire hazards in \nflammable environments.   \n \nAs such, it is recommended that:  \n1. Installation of Static Elimination Devices:  \no Ionizing Bars: Position ionizing bars at critical points, such as near unwind \nand rewind stations, to neut ralize static charges on the plastic film. This \nprevents dust attraction, reduces contamination, and minimizes operator \nshocks.  \no Ionizing Nozzles and Blowers: Utilize these devices to deliver ionized air \nonto specific areas of the film, effectively neutralizing static charges during \nprocesses like sheeting or bagging.  \n \n2. Proper Grounding and Conductive Pathways:  \no Ensure that all machinery components, including rollers and frames, are \nproperly grounded to provide a path for static dissipation. Ungrounded \ncondu ctive parts can accumulate charge, exacerbating static issues.  \n  \n3. Environmental Controls:  \no Humidity Control: Maintain optimal humidity levels within the production \nenvironment. Low humidity reduces air conductivity, increasing static \nbuildup. Using humidif iers can help mitigate this effect.  \n \n4. Material Handling Practices:  \no Antistatic Additives: Incorporate antistatic agents into plastic materials \nduring manufacturing to reduce their tendency to hold static charges.  \no Controlled Unwinding/Winding Speeds: Operate machinery at speeds that \nminimize friction and separation -induced static generation.  \n \n5. Regular Maintenance and Monitoring:  \no Equipment Inspection: Periodically inspect and clean rollers, ionizing \ndevices, and other components to ensure they function effec tively  \no Static Charge Monitoring: Use static meters to monitor charge levels on \nmaterials and equipment, allowing for timely intervention when high static \nlevels are detected.  \n \nBy implementing these measures, manufacturers can effectively control static electricity \nduring the unwinding and winding of plastic sheets, leading to improved product quality, enhanced safety, and increased operational efficiency.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\nManaging static electricity during the unwinding and winding of plastic sheet s is essential \nto ensure safety and maintain product quality. While there are no regulations exclusively \ndedicated to this specific process, several broader standards and guidelines address the \ncontrol of static electricity in industrial settings:  \n \n1. Nation al Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Guidelines  \nNFPA 77 – Recommended Practice on Static Electricity  \n• NFPA 77 is the key document addressing static electricity hazards across \nindustries.  \n• It provides detailed recommendations on identifying, evaluating, and mitigating \nstatic discharge risks.  \n• The guideline covers three key static control strategies:  \n \n(i) Grounding and Bonding:  \n• All metallic machine components, rollers, and frames involved in the plastic \nhandling process should be properly grounded to prevent charge buildup.  \n• Bonding ensures that all connected parts are at the same electrical potential, \npreventing spark discharge between surfaces.  \n \n(ii) Humidity Control:  \n• Static electricity generation increases in low humidity environments because dry \nair reduces the conductivity of the surrounding atmosphere.  \n• NFPA recommends maintaining a relative humidity of 50% to 65% to reduce static \ncharge accumulation on plastic surfaces.  \n \n(iii) Use of Antistatic Devices:  \n• Installation of ionization bars or ionizing blowers at winding and unwinding stations \nhelps to neutralize surface charges by introducing balanced positive and negative \nions into the air.  \n• Antistatic tinsel or grounded brushes can also be used to dissipate static charges.  \n \nApplication to Plastic Sheet Handling:  \n• Install ionization bars or blowers near the winding/unwinding points.  \n• Maintain controlled humidity within the processing area.  \n• Ensure that all components involved in the processing are grounded and bonded.  \n  \n \n2. MS 1979:2007 - Electrical Installations of Buildings - Code of Practice  \nThis Malaysian Standard offers guidelines for low voltage electrical installations in \nbuildings, emphasizing safety measures to protect against electrical hazards. While its \nprimary focus is on building electrical systems, several provisions are relevant to \ncontrolling static electricity during industrial processes, including the handling of plastic \nsheets  \n \nKey Provisions:  \n• Earthing (Grounding ) of Equipment: Ensures all electrical installations are properly \ngrounded to prevent the ac cumulation of static charges, thereby reducing the risk \nof electrical shocks and fires.  \n• Insulation of Live Conductors: Requires that all live conductors be insulated with \nmaterials like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or cross -linked polyethylene (XLPE) to \nprevent direct contact and potential static discharge.   • Use of Barriers or Enclosures: Recommends implementing physical barriers or \nenclosures to prevent unintended contact with live parts, which can be a source of \nstatic electricity.   \n \nApplication to Plastic  Sheet Handling:  \nWhile MS 1979:2007 is tailored for building electrical installations, its emphasis on \nproper grounding and insulation can be applied to machinery  used in the unwinding \nand winding of plastic sheets. Ensuring that all equipment is adequately grounded and \ninsulated can significantly reduce the buildup of static electricity during these \nprocesses.  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nList of References  List of references  \n1) OSHA Regulations (Standard – 29 CFR):  \nhttps://www.osha.gov/laws -regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910  \n2) Hazardous Chemical Safe Storage Compliance:  \nhttps://www.safetyinfo.com/safe -chemical -storage -osha -requirements -free-\nindex/  \n3) Control of Industrial Major Accident Hazard Regulation in Malaysia:  \nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/368692141_Control_of_industrial_m\najor_accident_hazard_regulation_in_Malaysia_second_decade_in_examinati\non#:~:text=The%20Control%20of%20Industrial%20Major,major%20hazard%2\n0risks%20are%20taken . \n4) Guidelines For Industrial Gas Cylinder 2021_JKKP:  \nhttps://oshe.uthm.edu.my/images/document/Biosafety/GUIDELINES_FOR_IN\nDUSTRIAL_GAS_CYLINDER%202021_JKKP.pdf  \n5) IEEE/ASHRAE Guide for the Ventilation and Thermal Management of \nBatteries for Stationary Applications : \nhttps://webstore.ansi.org/preview -\npages/ASHRAE/preview_IEEE+Std+1635TM -2018+ASHRAE+Guideline+21 -\n2018.pdf?srsltid=AfmBOooCphih3rOZJsyyIg6R -\nZzQtEnedgDmIggNPlhmxkDNErPs84 -j \n6) Guideline on Gas Piping System:  \nhttps://www.st.gov.my/en/contents/files/download/96/Guidelines_On_Gas_Pipi\nng_Systems_At_Laundrettes_And_Similar_Installations.pdf  \n7) Occupation Safety and health Standard 1910.178 Material Handling and \nStorage:  \nhttps://www.osha.gov/laws -\nregs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.178#:~:text=Battery%20charging\n%20installations%20shall%20be%20located%20in%20areas%20designated\n%20for%20that%20purpose.&text=Facilities%20shall%20be%20provided%20\nfor,of%20fumes%20from%20gassing%20batteries . \n8) Non-Domestic Electrical Installation Safety Code:  \nhttps://www.osha.gov/laws -\nregs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.178#:~:text=Battery%20charging\n%20installations%20shall%20be%20located%20in%20areas%20designated\n%20for%20that%20purpose.&text=Facilities%20shall%20be%20provided%20\nfor,of%20fumes%20from%20gassing%20batteries . \n9) Occupation Safety and health Standard 1910.252 Welding, Cutting and \nBrazing:  https://www.osha.gov/laws -regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.252  \n10) The Geotechnical Design Guidelines by JKR (Jabatan Kerja Raya)  \nhttp://epsmg.jkr.gov.my/images/c/c3/GEOTECHNICAL_DESIGN_GUIDELINE\nS.pdf  \n11) National Landscape Policy:  \nhttps://www.jln.gov.my/jln/resources/user_1/Text%20Documents/Dokumen%2\n0Penerbitan/Dasar%20Landskap%20Negara/dln_bi.pdf  \n12) Specification for Load Bearing Block Work System (JKR 20601 -0252 -18):  \nhttp://epsmg.jkr.gov.my/images/d/db/Specification_For_Load_Bearing_Blockw\nork_System_JKR_20601 -0252 -18.pdf  \n13) Wind Load Consideration in Structural Design:  \nhttps://ipm.my/wind -load-consideration -in-structural -design/  \n14) National Electrical Code (NEC) 110.26 -
