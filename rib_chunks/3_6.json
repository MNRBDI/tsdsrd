  "content": "Section 3.6: STORAGE OF COMBUSTIBLE MATERIAL\n\nOBSERVATION:\nThe storage area poses several fire safety risks due to improper arrangement. Mattresses \nand boxes are stacked in a disorganized and overcrowded manner, which can impede \nquick access to fire safety equipment and emergency exits. The lack of proper spacing \nbetween items limits ventilation, increasing the risk of heat buildup and potential fire \nignition.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nThe correct storage of combustible materials is paramount. Understanding the risks \ncombustible materials pose, and understanding how to control these risks, can help to \nprevent fires and explosions.  \n \nAs such, it is recommended that,  \n1. Proper Organization of Stored Items  \n• Proper Height and Stability: Items, especially large and bulky ones like \nmattresses, should be stacked at a safe height. Following manufacturer or \nindustry guidelines for stacking heights ensures that the structure remains \nstable and reduces the risk of items toppling over. Over stacking increases the \nchance of items falling, which can obstruct exits, cause injuries, or potentially \ntrigger a fire hazard if flammable items are involved.  \n• Secure Stacking: Items must be stacked securely using shelving units or \npallets to prevent any movement. Flammable materials should be arranged so \nthat they do not lean or shift, which could cause instability and increase the \nlikelihood of accidents.  \n• Maximize Space Efficiency: he storage area should be organized to optimize \nthe available space without overcrowding. Overcrowding creates the risk of \nblocked aisles, making it difficult for staff to access stored materials, \nemergency exits, or fire safety equipment during an emergency. Having clearly \nmarked aisles or walkways ensures that there is adequate space for personnel \nto move safely in the event of a fire.  \n \n2. Designate Fire -Safe Storage Areas  \n• Separate Combustible Materials: Materials that are highly combustible, such as \nmattresses or expanded foam should be stored in designated areas away from \nother less hazardous items. This prevents the spread of fire to non -flammable \ngoods and helps ensure that fire risks are contained in one area. In some \ncases, it may be necessary to install fire -resistant partitions or barriers to \nfurther limit the risk of fire spreading from one storage area to another. These barriers help contain a fire to a small zone, allowing staff more time to evacuate \nand control the situation.  \n• Clear Separation of Storage Zones: The storage area should be clearly marked \nto differentiate between safe and fire -hazard zones. For instance, use clearly \nvisible signage to indicate fire hazard areas where flammable materials are \nstored, and ensure these areas are kept free from unnecessary items that \ncould act as fuel in the event of a fire.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\n1. Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) 1994  \nSection 15 - Duty to Ensure Safety and Health at Work  \n• Employers' Responsibility:  Employers are required to ensure the safety, health, \nand welfare of employees at work. This includes:  \n• Ensuring that proper storage and handling of combustible materials are \nimplemented to avoid risk to employees.  \n• Providing safe working conditions, which include safe storage for \nhazardous materials.  \nSection 24 - Reporting of Dangerous Occurrences  \n• Any dangerous occurrences involving combustible materials must be reported to \nthe Department of Occupational Safety and Health (DOSH) immediately.  \n \n2. Fire Services Act 1988  \nThe Fire Services Act 1988  governs fire safety in Malaysia, including the storage of \ncombustible materials.  \nSection 10 - Fire Prevention  \n• Fire Safety Measures: All premises where combustible materials are stored must \nhave proper fire prevention measures. This includes:  \n• Installation of fire alarms, sprinkler systems, and fire extinguishers.  \n• Ensuring that the building’s fire protection system is maintained and \noperational.  \nSection 11 - Fire Risk Assessment  \n• A Fire Risk Assessment  must be conducted to evaluate the risks associated with \nstoring combustible materials.  \n• Identifying fire hazards, including ignition sources, and assessing whether \ncombustible materials are stored in a way that could cause fires.  \nSection 12 - Fire Safety in Buildings  \n• For buildings storing combustible materials, specific fire safety measures must be \nfollowed:  \n• The building must be designed to prevent the spread of fire.  \n• Materials must be separated and stored in appropriate fire -rated rooms or \nareas.  \nSection 14 - Fire Protection Plans  \n• Fire protection plans must be prepared for premises that store combustible \nmaterials.  \n• The plans should detail evacuation routes, emergency exits, and the \nlocation of fire -fighting equipment.  \n \n3. Uniform Building By -Law (UBBL) 1984  \nThe Uniform Building By -Law (UBBL) 1984  provides detailed regulations regarding the \nconstruction and maintenance of buildings, including provisions for fire safety and the \nstorage of hazardous materials.  \nPart 7 – Fire Protection and Safety  \nThis section details the design, construction, and fire safety measures for buildings, \nparticularly those storing combustible materials.  Section 147 - Fire Compartments and Fire -Resistant Structures  \n• Fire-Rated Compartmentalization: Areas where combustible materials are stored \nshould be compartmentalized to prevent the spread of fire. These compartments \nmust be constructed using fire -resistant materials.  \n• Fireproof Doors and Partitions: Fireproof doors, windows, and partitions must be \nused to separate storage areas from other parts of the building.  \nSection 148 - Storage of Combustible Materials  \n• Storage Requirements: Combustible materials must be stored in a manner that \nminimizes the risk of fire. This includes:  \n• Ensuring adequate ventilation to avoid the accumulation of flammable \ngases.  \n• Storing materials at a safe distance from ignition sources.  \n• Regular maintenance to prevent the buildup of combustible dust or other \nmaterials that may contribute to fire risks.  \nSection 149 - Emergency Exits and Evacuation Routes  \n• Evacuation Routes: Buildings storing combustible materials must have clearly \nmarked and accessible evacuation routes to allow quick evacuation in the event of \na fire.  \n• Exit Doors: Emergency exit doors should be fire -resistant and wide enough to \naccommodate quick evacuation.",
