  "content": "Section 5.9: TANK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nOBSERVATION:\nThere is no proper tank management program adopted by the insured.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nA Tank Management Program (TMP) is a structured approach to managing storage tanks, \nensuring their integrity, safety, and operational efficiency through proper design, \nconstruction, inspection, maintenance, and repair. Various international and Malaysian \nstandards provide detailed guidelines to regulate the management of storage tanks, \nincluding material selection, thickness testing, fire safety, and environmental protection.  \n \nA comprehensive Tank Management Program (TMP) is essential to ensure the integrity, \nsafety, and operational efficiency of storage tanks. The program should cover tank design \nand construction following API 650 and BS 2654 standards, ensuring minimum shell \nthickness of 6 mm and proper foundation design to handle structural loads. Regular \ninspections are crucial, with external and ultrasonic thickness testing (UTT) conducted \nevery 5 years and internal inspections every 10 years, as per API 653 and MS 2523. \nCorrosion control measures, including protective coatings and cathodic protection, should \nbe implemented to prevent metal thinning. Repairs and alterations must comply with API \n653 guidelines, with weld repairs subjected to non -destructive testing (NDT). Operational \nmeasures, such as continuous pressure and temperature monitoring, emergency venting, \nand overpressure protection, should align with API 620 and BS 2654 requirements. Proper \ndocumentation of inspections, repairs, and thickness measurements should be \nmaintained, while trained and certified personnel should oversee TMP implementation to \nensure compliance and enhance safety and efficiency.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\nThe most relevant standards related to Tank Management Programs (TMP) primarily focus \non the design, construction, inspection, maintenance, and repair of storage tanks. Below \nare the key standards, including their timeline requirements and technical aspects such as \nallowable thickness, inspection intervals, and other operational parameters:  \n \n1. API 650 – Welded Tanks for Oil Storage  \nScope and Purpose  \nAPI 650 is the key standard for the design and construction of new welded storage tanks \nfor oil and petroleum products. It covers tanks with internal pressures up to 2.5 psi and \noperating temperatures betwee n −40°F and 500°F.  \n \nKey Technical Aspects  \n• Tank Material and Thickness:  \no Minimum thickness for carbon steel: 1/4 inch (6.35 mm).  \no Tanks with diameters greater than 15 m should have a minimum shell \nthickness of 6 mm.  \no Corrosion allowance should be added based o n service conditions.  \n \n• Design Requirements:  \no Allowable stress limits for different materials based on operating pressure \nand temperature.  \no Wind and seismic load considerations.  \no Annular plates required for tanks greater than 30 m in diameter.  \n • Inspection Requirements:  \no Shell and bottom thickness must be measured during construction.  \no Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) of welds (ultrasonic, radiographic) is \nmandatory.  \n \nTimeline for Inspection and Testing  \nActivity  Frequency  Details  \nVisual Inspection  Monthly  External check for leaks, \ncorrosion, and structural integrity.  \nUltrasonic \nThickness Test \n(UTT)  Every 5 years (or more often \nbased on corrosion rate)  Evaluate corrosion rate and \nremaining thickness.  \nInternal Inspection  Every 10 years  Comprehensive inspection of \nshell, bottom, and roof.  \nHydrostatic Test  After construction or major \nrepair  Hold for 24 hours, test pressure at \n1.25x design pressure.  \n \n2. API 653 – Tank Inspection, Repair, Alteration, and Reconstruction  \nScope and Purpose  \nAPI 653 governs the inspection, repair, alteration, and reconstruction of existing tanks built \nto API 650 or similar standards. It ensures that tanks remain fit for service over their \nlifetime.  \nKey Technical Aspects  \n• Minimum Shell Thickness:  \no For tanks over 30 m in diameter: Minimum shell thickness = 6 mm.  \no Minimum bottom plate thickness = 6 mm.  \n \n• Corrosion Rate Calculation:  \no Corrosion rate = (Original thickness - Current thickness) ÷ Years of service.  \no Minimum acceptable shell thickness should not fall below calculated \nminimum based on stress limits.  \n \n• Repair Guidelines:  \no If thickness is below minimum, plate replacement or weld overlay is \nrequired.  \no Bottom patching allowed if patch overlaps extend at least 50 mm beyond \nthe thinned area.  \n \n• Weld Quality and Inspection:  \no NDT (radiography and ultrasonic) required for weld joints.  \no Weld repairs must follow pre -approved welding procedures.  \n \nTimeline for Inspection and Testing  \nActivity  Frequency  Details  \nExternal Inspection  Every 5 years  Visual inspection of shell, roof, \nnozzles, and foundation.  \nUltrasonic Thickness \nTest (UTT)  Every 5 years (or based on \ncorrosion rate)  Shell, roof, and bottom thickness \nmeasurements.  \nInternal Inspection  Every 10 years  Detailed check of bottom and \ninternal surfaces.  Leak Testing  Every 10 years or after \nmajor repair  Use vacuum box, tracer gas, or \nhydrostatic testing.  \n \n3. API 620 – Design and Construction of Large, Low -Pressure Storage Tanks  \nScope and Purpose  \nAPI 620 covers tanks that store products at low pressures (up to 15 psig) and low \ntemperatures (down to −325°F). It focuses on larger tanks used for cryogenic or \nrefrigerated liquids.  \nKey Technical Aspects  \n• Minimum Thickness:  \no Minimum bottom plate thickness = 6 mm.  \no Minimum shell thickness = 6 mm for carbon steel tanks.  \no Additional thickness required for vacuum service or thermal stress.  \n \n• Design Pressure and Temperature:  \no Maximum allowable stress based on tank material and temperature.  \no Pressure relief valves and vacuum breakers must be installed.  \n \n• Seismic and Wind Load:  \no Calculation based on regional seismic data and wind speed limits.  \no Foundation design to accommodate settlement and thermal movement.  \n \nTimeline for Inspection and Testing  \nActivity  Frequency  Details  \nExternal \nInspection  Annually  Assess shell, roof, and insulation \ncondition.  \nInternal \nInspection  Every 10 years  Bottom and shell ultrasonic testing, weld \nquality check.  \nLeak Testing  After construction or major \nrepair  Pneumatic or hydrostatic testing.  \n \n4. BS 2654 – Manufacture of Vertical, Cylindrical, Welded Steel Tanks  \nScope and Purpose  \nBS 2654 is a British standard covering the construction and installation of vertical \ncylindrical tanks used for petroleum and other liquids.  \nKey Technical Aspects  \n• Minimum Thickness:  \no Minimum bottom plate thickness = 6 mm.  \no Minimum shell thickness depends on tank height and diameter.  \n \n• Design Pressure and Temperature:  \no Max operating pressure = 2.5 psi.  \no Design for thermal expansion and contraction.  \n \n• Inspection and Repair:  \no Shell distortion = maximum ±1% of the shell height.  \no Foundation settlement should not exceed 12 mm.  \n \nTimeline for Inspection and Testing  \nActivity  Frequency  Details  \nExternal Inspection  Every 5 years  Assess shell, roof, and foundation.  Internal Inspection  Every 10 years  Detailed thickness check and weld assessment.  \nPressure Test  After major repairs  Hydrostatic testing at 1.25x design pressure.  \n \n \n5. MS 2523:2013 – Code of Practice for Storage Tanks for Petroleum Products  \nScope and Purpose  \nMS 2523 is a Malaysian standard based on API 650 and 653 but adapted to local \nregulations and conditions. It applies to both new and existing tanks for petroleum \nproducts.  \nKey Technical Aspects  \n• Minimum Thickness:  \no Shell and bottom plate = 6 mm minimum.  \no Roof plate = 5 mm minimum.  \n \n• Inspection and Maintenance:  \no Corrosion allowance = 1 mm minimum.  \no Emergency venting required for pressure relief.  \n \nTimeline for Inspection and Testing  \nActivity  Frequency  Details  \nExternal \nInspection  Every 5 years  Shell, roof, and foundation inspection.  \nInternal \nInspection  Every 10 years  Thickness measurement and NDT.  \nPressure Test  After major repair or \nrelocation  Hydrostatic testing at 1.25x design \npressure.",
