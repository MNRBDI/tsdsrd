This \nmay pose  to following risks:  \n \n1) Dead Trees:  \n• Trees that have died due to diseases, pest infestations (such as termites or \nbeetles), or natural decay are at a high risk of falling. Dead trees are structurally \nweak and can collapse suddenly, causing injury, property damage, or even \nfatalities.  \n \n2) Broken or Hanging Branches:  \n• Detached or partially broken branches, especially those hanging from significant \nheights, may fall unexpectedly. This can be hazardous to pedestrians, vehicles, \nand nearby structures.  \n \n3) Material Fall from Trees:  \n• Objects such as nests, fruits, or broken branches can fall without warning, posing a \nthreat to people and property below.  \n \n4) Signs of Disease or Structural Weakness:  \n• Presence of fungi, mushrooms, or perennial fruiting bodies on the trunk or \nbranches indicates internal decay and structural weakness.  \n• Disease symptoms such as leaf discoloration, premature shedding, or cankers can \nalso signal compromised health and stability.  \n \n5) Leaning Trees:  \n• Trees with a tilt greater than 10 degrees from the vertical pose a higher potential \nfor failure, especially during heavy rains, strong winds, or seismic activity.  \n \n6) Cracks in Trunks and Branches:  \n• Visible cracks are clear signs of compromised structural integrity, increasing the \nlikelihood of collapse during storms or high wind events.  \n \n7) Soil Heaving or Uplift:  \n• Disturbances around tree roots, such as soil heaving or uplift, indicate potential \nroot failure. Such trees may be ready to fall at any moment, particularly under \nadverse weather conditions  \n \nRecommendation  \n \nIt is advised that the participant examine, identify and appropriately maintain the trees by \neither pruning or eliminating the impacted trees in order to lessen the risks of a tree \ncollapsing. Following are among risk mitigation that could be done:  \n \n1) Tree Risk Assessment and Inspection:  \n• Regularly inspect all trees within the area, especially those located near high -traffic \nzones, parking lots, and structures.  \n• Engage certified arborists or tree risk assessment experts to evaluate tree health \nand structural integrity using standardized assessment tools.  \n \n2)  Pruning and Removal:  \n• Remove dead trees immediately to prevent accidental falls.  • Prune damaged or diseased branches to eliminate weak points and improve \noverall tree health.  \n• Implement preventive pruning to enhance structural stability and prevent the \nlikelihood of large branches breaking off during extreme weather conditions.  \n \n3) Disease Management:  \n• Monitor trees for signs of disease and take appropriate action to control or \neliminate the disease spread.  \n• Implement pest control measures where necessary to prevent infestations that \nmay compromise tree health.  \n \n4) Proactive Monitoring:  \n• Install monitoring devices where necessary to detect early signs of instability, such \nas tilting sensors or soil movement indicators.  \n \n5) Tree Support Systems:  \n• Where appropriate, install cabling, bracing, or guying systems to support \nstructurally weakened trees and minimize the risk of failure.  \n \nRegulation / Guideline  \n \n1) The Town and Country Planning Act 1976 (Act 172)  addresses the preservation \nand management of trees  under Part VA – Tree Preservation Order , particularly \nin Sections 35A to 35H . Here's a summary of the relevant parts  (35A and 35E) : \n \n1.1) Section 35A (Tree Preservation Order):  \n- The local planning authority can issue a tree preservation order if it's \nnecessary to preserve trees for amenity purposes.  \n- The order can prohibit the felling of trees with out written permission from \nthe local planning authority.  \n- It can also require the planting or replanting of trees as directed by the \nauthority.  \nExemptions include trees that are dying, dead, or present an imminent \ndanger  \n \n1.2) Section 35E (Replacement of trees ): \n- Any person found guilty of unauthorized felling must replace the tree with \nanother of appropriate size and species at a specified location  \n \n \n2) Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994 (OSHA):  \nWhile not exclusively focused on tree management, OSHA mandates that employers \nensure the safety, health, and welfare of their workers. This includes implementing \nsafety measures during tree maintenance activities, such as pruning or removal, to \nprotect workers from potential hazards",

    "content": "Section 1.8: WINDSTORM\n\nOBSERVATION:\nThe Administration, Academic, and Library Building (1 OP) has experienced multiple \nincidents of wind damage to the strip ceilings at the roof level. In September 2023, a \nsignificant wind event caused one strip ceiling to be blown away and damaged several \nothers. According to the participant, similar incidents have occurred on multiple occasions \npreviously but were not reported to the takaful operator. After each event, the damaged \nstrip ceiling was replaced without further investigation or mitigation measures.  \n \nThis repetitive pattern of damage highlights the inadequacy of current construction and \nmaintenance practices, suggesting the need for a more comprehensive and proactive \napproach to managing wind -induced risks.  \n \nThe following risk assessment s should be carried out to identify  any possible and inherent  \ncause s arises from the event : \n \n1)  Vulnerability to Strong Winds:  \n• The building's roof and strip ceiling structures are highly exposed to strong wind \nforces, especially during stormy weather conditions.  \n• The design and construction of the strip ceilings may not be adequate to withstand \nhigh wind pressures, leading to repeated failures.  \n•  \n2)  Potential Consequences:  \n• Structural damage to the building due to compromised ceilings.  \n• Potential safety hazards to occupants and pedestrians due to falling debris.  \n• Increased financial losses from repeated repairs and replacements.  \n• Potential reputational damage and increased insurance premiums if incidents \npersist.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nWe recommend that a more comprehensive and proactive approach be taken instead of \nmerely replacing the damaged strip ceilings after each incident . The followings mitigation \nplans shall be explored : \n \n1. Proactive Maintenance and Inspection:  \n• Quarterly Inspections:  \no Conduct scheduled inspections of the strip ceilings at least every three \nmonths, focusing on areas most exposed to prevailing wind directions.  \n• Post-Event Inspections:  \no Perform immediate inspections after each windstorm or strong wind event \nto assess damage and identify any weakened areas.  \n• Inspection Records:  \no Maintain detailed records of all inspections, including observations, \nidentified issues, and remedial actions taken.  \n• Professional Assessment:  \no Engage a professional roofing inspector or structural engineer to evaluate \nthe adequacy of the current installation and recommend improvements.  \n \n2. Enhanced Roof Strengthening Measures:  \n• Strengthening the Roof Structure:  \no Implement structural enhancements, such as:  \n▪ Installing gable bracing to support roof ends and reduce lateral movement.  \n▪ Utilizing roof nailing techniques that secure the roof deck more \neffectively to the supporting structures.  \n▪ Applying hurricane clips or straps to secure roof components.  \n• Reinforced Materials:  \no Upgrade the quality and durability of strip ceilings with materials that have \nhigher wind resistance.  \no Use weather -resistant fasteners and adhesives to secure the ceilings more \nfirmly.  \n \n3. Design and Construction Improvements:  \n• Wind Load Assessment:  \no Conduct a thorough analysis of the wind loads expected at the site, \nconsidering factors such as wind speed, wind direction, and building \ngeometry.  \n• Structural Integrity Enhancement:  \no Evaluate the connection points and support systems of the strip ceilings to \nensure they can withstand anticipated wind forces.  \n• Aerodynamic Considerations:  \no Redesign the strip ceiling profiles to reduce wind resistance and minimize \nthe likelihood of being lifted or blown away.  \n \n4. Expert Consultation and Mitigation Measures:  \n• If incidents continue to occur despite the above measures, it is recommended to:  \no Engage a qualified structural consultant or wind engineering expert to \nconduct an in -depth assessment.  \no Identify the root causes of failure and explore alternative construction \ntechniques or materials.  \no Implement wind mitigation strategies that are proven effective in similar \nenvironments\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\nThe primary standard governing wind loading for building structures in Malaysia is MS \n1553:2002 - Code of Practice on Wind Loading for Building Structure . This standard \noutlines the procedures to determine wind speeds and the resulting wind actions that \nstructures must withstand. Wind load specified as per MS1553 with a minimum basic wind \nspeed of 33.5m/s for Zone I while 32.5m/s for Zone II.  \n \n  \nAccording to Wind Load Consideration in Structural Design (by Ir. Dr. Justin L ai Woon \nFatt), the minimum wind forces  the main structural system must resist should be at least \n0.65 kN/m², multiplied by the area of the building or structure as seen in a vertical plane \nperpendicular to the wind direction.",

    "content": "Section 1.9: IMPACT DAMAGE FROM LIFTING ACTIVITIES\n\nOBSERVATION:\nThere is evidence of impact damage to the walls and roof of the factory resulting from \nlifting activities carried out by lorries and other large vehicles. These damages may occur \ndue to poor manoeuvring , inadequate clearance, or improper handling of heavy materials \nduring loading and unloading operations.  \n \nThe continued occurrence of such incidents could result in structural damage, \ncompromising the integrity of the building and potentially causing safety hazards to \npersonnel and equipment within the factory premises.  \n \nThe risk assessment on caused of damage and potential consequences from this kind of \nrisk/hazard shall be carried out as follows.  \n \n1. Causes of Damage:  \no Inadequate clearance between vehicles and factory walls/roof during lifting \noperations.  \no Poorly designed loading/unloading areas that do not account for the size and \nheight of lorries and large vehicles.  \no Insufficient guidance systems or markings for safe manoeuvring . \no Lack of proper training for vehicle operators on safe lifting and maneuvering \nprocedures.  \no Absence of barriers or protective structures to prevent accidental impact.  \n \n2. Potential Consequences:  \no Structural damage to the factory’s walls and roof, leading to expensive repairs \nor reconstruction.  \no Increased risk of injury to workers and visitors due to falling debris or \ncompromised structures.  \no Disruption of operations and potential downtime if critical areas are damaged.  \no Insurance claims or increased premiums due to repeated incidents of damage.  \no Loss of reputation and credibility for failing to implement adequate safety \nmeasures.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nTo mitigate the risks associated with impact damage, the following measures are strongly \nrecommended:  \n \n1. Physical Barriers and Protective Structures:  \n• Install protective barriers, bollards, or railings at strategic points to prevent vehicles \nfrom making direct contact with factory walls and roofs.  \n• Construct roof guards or height restrictors where applicable, especially where \nvehicles may inadvertently hit overhead structures.  \n \n2. Clear Markings and Guidance Systems:  \n• Mark all loading/unloading zones with high -visibility paint or reflective tape to \ndelineate safe paths for vehicles.  \n• Install warning signs and height restriction indicators to alert drivers to potential \ncollision points.  \n• Consider installing mirrors or visual aids to enhance visibility for drivers when \nmanoeuvring  in tight spaces.  \n \n3. Improved Loading/Unloading Area Design:  • Review and redesign the layout of loading/unloading areas to ensure sufficient \nclearance for lorries and other large vehicles.  \n• Provide dedicated zones for lifting activities, separated from pedestrian pathways \nand vulnerable structures.  \n \n4. Operator Training and Safe Operating Procedures:  \n• Implement regular training programs for vehicle operators focusing on safe lifting \nand manoeuvring  procedures.  \n• Provide training on proper vehicle positioning, safe speed limits, and lifting \ntechniques to minimize the risk of impact.  \n \nBy implementing these recommendations, the risk of structural damage from lifting \nactivities by lorries and large vehicles can be significantly reduced. Enhanced safety \nmeasures will protect both the physical infrastructure of the factory and the safety of \npersonnel, ultimately resulting in cost savings and improved operational efficiency.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\nSafety and Health Act 1994 (OSHA 1994)  \n \nSection 15: General Duties of Employers  \n- Employers are required to ensure, as far as is practicable, the safety, health, and \nwelfare at work of all their employees.  \n \nNote: This includes providing and maintaining a safe working environment and \nensuring that plant and machinery are safe and without health risks.  \n \nSection 24: General Duties of Employee  \n- to take reasonable care for the safety and health of himself  and of other persons \nwho may be affected by his acts or  omissions at work . \n \nNote: Employees are obligated to take reasonable care for their own safety and health, \nas well as that of others who may be affected by their actions at work.

It is protected by a chain -link fence and plastic impact barriers \npositioned along the side most exposed to vehicle traffic from the parking bays. However, \nthe current use of plastic barriers is considered inadequate to prevent significant vehicle \nimpact, especially from larger vehicles or high -speed collisions. If compromised, this \nstation poses a severe risk of natural gas leaks, explosions, and subsequent fire hazards.  \n \nThe hazard identified from this are as follows:  \n- Potential impact damage from vehicles due to inadequate barrier strength.  \n- Risk of gas leaks from damaged piping or control systems following a vehicle \ncollision.  \n- Increased likelihood of ignition sources in case of gas leaks due to the proximity of \nvehicles.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nTo mitigate the risks associated with impact damage, the following measures are strongly \nrecommended:  \n \n1. Replace Plastic Impact Barriers with Reinforced Concrete Barriers:  \n• Install reinforced concrete impact barriers permanently along the side of the \nnatural gas reducing and metering station that is exposed to the car parking bays.  \n• Ensure that the barriers are constructed to withstand high -impact forces, providing \nrobust protection against accidental vehicle collisions.  \n• The design should adhere to relevant standards, ensuring barriers are tall and \nwide enough to provide effective coverage  \n \n2. Enhanced Perimeter Protection:  \n• In addition to concrete barriers, consider enhancing the chain -link fence with \nimpact -resistant guardrails or steel bollards for added security.  \n• The installation should cover all sides that may be exposed to vehicle movement, \nnot just the most vulnerable side  \n \n3.

Many of these electrical fires result from improper terminations, poor \nworkmanship, different characteristics of dissimilar metals, improper binding screw or \nsplicing devices, environmental and atmospheric condition present at the facility.  \n \nCombustibles materials stored close to electrical panel and incoming electrical board \ncould be ignited by electrical fault/flashover in the event of electrical malfunction or short \ncircuiting. Spark or ignition source will land on the nearby carton boxes/combustible \nmaterial and start the fire in the storage area.  \n \nTo minimize the fire risk, we recommend that all electrical panels be kept clear of \ncombustible materials. A yellow square marking should be drawn on the floor, and a \nbarricade should be placed within a 1.5 -meter radius around the electrical panel to \nindicate that no materials are to be stored near the panel\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\nIn Malaysia, the use of combustible materials  around electrical switchboards is \nregulated under several standards, including MS 1933  (Code of Practice for Electrical \nInstallations), MS 1979  (Code of Practice for Electrical Installations of Buildings), and the \nUniform Building By -Laws (UBBL) . These guidelines aim to ensure that electrical \ninstallations are safe, reduce the risk of fire, and protect both property and lives.  \n \nMS 1933: Code of Practice for Electrical Installations  \n• Section 3: General Requirements for Electrical Installations  \no Clause 3.3.4 ( Safety of electrical equipment): It specifies that all electrical \ninstallations should be designed, installed, and maintained to ensure safety \nunder normal operating conditions. This includes protecting against fire \nhazards, which can be caused by combustible materials in proximity to electrical equipment such as switchboards, panel boards, or distribution \nboards.  \no  \nMS 1979: Code of Practice for Electrical Installations - Low Voltage Installations  \n1. Clause 4.4 - Location of Electrical Equipment  \nThis clause states that electrical equipment, including switchboards, should be \ninstalled in locations that minimize the risk of fire or damage. It emphasizes that \nelectrical installations should not be placed near combustible materials that could \ncatch fire in the event of an electrical fault, overheating, or short circuit.  \n \n• Clause 4.6 - Clearances Around Electrical Equipment  \nElectrical switchboards must maintain a certain clearance from combustible \nmaterials to ensure safe operation and ease of maintenance. This clearance also \nallows heat dissipation and minimizes the risk of fire hazards due to overheating of \nelectrical components.  \n \n• Clause 5.1 - General Installation Requirements  \nThis clause specifies that all installations should be properly maintained and kept \nclear of any potential hazards, including combustible materials. The area around \nelectrical switchboards must be free from storage of flammable or combustible \nsubstances to reduce the risk of fire or electric shock.",

    "content": "Section 2.5: EXPOSED WIRING\n\nOBSERVATION:\nIt is observed that there is a lot of exposed wiring in the showroom.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nAll exposed wires pose an electrical safety hazard, but exposed wiring within the structure \nof the building is of particular concern because it represents a hidden danger. When \nexposed wiring occurs in the structure of a building, it can easily be in close proximity to \nflammable materials, posing an increased risk of an electrical fire.  \n \nFires caused by exposed wires can spread rapidly, especially if they occur in enclosed \nspaces or areas with a high concentration of flammable materials. It is essential to \nunderstand that even a small spark from an exposed wire can quickly escalate into a full -\nblown fire. This is because the heat generated by the spark can ignite nearby materials, \nand the resulting fire can be fuelled by the electricity flowing through the wire. Therefore, it \nis crucial to address exposed wires promptly to prevent fire hazards.  \n \nTo ensure safety, it’s essential to properly cover any exposed wiring with electrical \ninsulation or enclosures to avoid accidental contact. All wiring connections must be \nprovided with an approved junction box, especially for connections that are intended to be \nmade later.  \n \nSample of approved junction box as below.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\nSuruhanjaya Tenaga (Energy Commission of Malaysia)  and Malaysian Standards \n(MS)  provide guidelines and regulations to ensure electrical safety and standards in various electrical installations, including for exposed wiring. These regulations cover \nvarious aspects such as wiring installation, safety measures, equipment, and inspection \nprocedures to ensure the safety of users and to minimize the risks associated with \nelectrical hazards.  \n \n1. MS 1933: 2015 – Code of Practice for the Electrical Wiring of Buildings  \n• General Wiring Safety: MS 1933 outlines the minimum requirements for the \ndesign, installation, and maintenance of electrical wiring in buildings. This includes \nguidelines for exposed wiring, which should be installed in such a way as to \nprevent electrical hazards and allow for future maintenance.  \n• Exposed Wiring Requirements: The standard includes specific requirements \nregarding exposed wiring in different areas of buildings. Wiring should be protected \nby conduits or enclosures, particularly in areas that are more prone to physical \ndamage. For example:  \no Indoor wiring should be securely fastened and protected with conduit if \nexposed.  \no Outdoor or external wiring should use weather -resistant materials and be \nenclosed in durable conduit to protect against the elements.  \n• Fire Safety Measures: Wiring systems must be installed with consideration to fire \nsafety. Exposed wiring should be insulated and installed in a way that minimizes \nthe risk of overheating or sparking, especially near combustible materials.  \n• Electrical Equipment Enclosures: MS 1933 also specifies that electrical equipment, \nsuch as junction boxes, must be securely mounted and properly enclosed to avoid \nelectrical shock hazards.  \n \n2. MS IEC 60364 – Electrical Installations of Buildings  \nThis is an internationally recognized standard that has been adapted into Malaysian \nstandards, which outlines the general rules for the electrical installations in buildings.  \n• Wiring Systems: Exposed wiring should be installed according to the proper \nclassifications. For example, Class I, II, and III protection methods may be used \ndepending on the environment.  \n• Fire Hazard Prevention: The standard emphasizes the need to minimize fire \nhazards by using correct cable types, ensuring adequate grounding, and securing \ncables away from flammable materials.  \n \n3. Suruhanjaya Tenaga (Energy Commission) Guidelines – Guidelines for \nElectrical Installations (GEI)  \nThe GEI is based on and is a part of the Electricity Supply Act 1990 and the Electricity \nRegulations 1994. These pieces of legislation set out the legal framework within which \nelectrical installations in Malaysia must be carried out. The GEI sets the requirements for \nsafe electrical installations in buildings, ensuring that electrical wiring is installed, \nmaintained, and used in a way that prevents risks such as electrical fires or electric \nshocks.  \n• Exposed Wiring and Safety: The Energy Commission mandates that exposed \nwiring should be properly insulated and protected, using appropriate conduits and \nenclosures, to prevent accidental contact, damage, or fire.  \n• Risk Mitigation: Installations must be carried out by qualified electricians, and all \nwork must meet prescribed safety standards. Exposed wiring should be minimized \nor covered wherever possible to reduce the risk of fire or shock.  \n• Regulation on Overhead and Underground Wiring  \nThe Energy Commission provides specific guidelines on overhead and \nunderground wiring installations. Exposed wiring should be properly secured and \nprotected to avoid environmental damage, especially in high -risk areas where \nthere could be exposure to physical damage, moisture, or other hazards.",

    "title": "BURN MARK AT THE CIRCUIT BREAKER",
    "content": "Section 2.6: BURN MARK AT THE CIRCUIT BREAKER\n\nOBSERVATION:\nIt was noted that one of the circuit breakers has an obvious burn mark.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nBurn marks on a circuit breaker indicate electrical problems within the system. They are \nthe result of localized overheating within the breaker panel or box. Typically, these marks \noccur due to loose or corroded components and connections, which introduce resistance \nand cause excessive heat generation. Burn marks aren’t just a cosmetic issue; they are a \nwarning of impending danger. These marks can be a precursor to electrical shorts, \npotentially leading to electrical fires or even electric shocks if left unattended.  \nAs such, it is recommended that the circuit breaker:  \n \n1. Tighten all wire connections  to the circuit breaker. Loose electrical connections \nat the breaker or on the wires connected to it can create resistance. This \nresistance in the circuit leads to heat buildup, which can cause burning or charring \nat the connection points.  \n2. Replace faulty breakers  with new, properly rated ones. A malfunctioning or aged \ncircuit breaker might fail to trip during an overload or short circuit, causing heat to \naccumulate and burn marks to appear.  \n3. Investigate the circuit  to identify and fix any short circuits. This may involve \nchecking wiring and outlets for faults, replacing damaged wires, or inspecting \nappliances that may have caused the short. A large current surge can generate \nsignificant heat, causing the circuit breaker to overheat and resulting in burn marks \nor charring around the breaker area.  \n4. Ensure that the total electrical load  on the circuit does not exceed the breaker’s \nrating. If necessary, redistribute the load across other circuits or upgrade to a \nhigher -rated breaker. An overloaded circuit occurs when too many electrical \ndevices or appliances are connected to the same circuit, drawing more current \nthan the breaker is rated for.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\nSuruhanjaya Tenaga (Energy Commission) and Malaysian Standards (MS) provide \ncomprehensive guidelines and regulations that cover electrical safety, including \naddressing issues like overloaded circuits, damaged circuit breakers, and burn marks at \ncircuit breakers. These regulations aim to ensure that electrical systems are safe and \nreliable, preventing hazards such as fires, electric shocks, and electrical failures.  \n \n1. Suruhanjaya Tenaga (Energy Commission) Guidelines – Guidelines for \nElectrical Installations (GEI)   \nThe GEI is based on and is a part of the Electricity Supply Act 1990  and the Electricity \nRegulations 1994 . These pieces of legislation set out the legal framework within which \nelectrical installations in Malaysia must be carried out. The GEI issued by Suruhanjaya \nTenaga provides detailed instructions on how electrical systems, including circuit breakers, \nshould be installed, maintained, and inspected:  \n• Circuit Breakers & Overload Protection: Circuit breakers should be correctly sized \naccording to the load requirements and should protect the system from overloads \nor short circuits. If the breaker is under -sized for the circuit, it will not trip properly \nduring an overload or short circuit, which may lead to overheating or burn marks.  \n• Faulty Circuit Breaker Protection: If a circuit breaker shows signs of burning or \ncharring, it could be a sign that it is faulty or that there has been a prolonged \novercurrent event. The guidelines recommend replacing faulty breakers \nimmediately to maintain safety and to avoid electrical fires.  \n• Inspection & Testing: The Energy Commission mandates regular inspections of \nelectrical installations, including breakers, to ensure that they are functioning \nproperly and are safe to use.  \n \n2. MS 1933: 2015 – Code of Practice for the Electrical Wiring of Buildings  \nThis standard outlines  the requirements for electrical wiring in buildings, including the \nproper installation of circuit breakers:  \n• Proper Sizing of Circuit Breakers: MS 1933 emphasizes the importance of \ncorrectly sizing the circuit breakers based on the wire gauge and expected load to \nprevent overheating, overloading, or tripping issues.  \n• Exposed Wires and Circuit Breaker Protection: In the case of burn marks, this \nstandard recommends ensuring that all circuit breakers are protected from \nenvironmental damage (e.g., water, heat) and that exposed wiring is securely \nmounted and insulated.  \n \n3. MS IEC 60364 – Electrical Installations of Buildings  \nThis standard is based on the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC 60364) and \noutlines safety requirements for electrical installations:  \n• Overload Protection: MS IEC 60364 mandates that circuit breakers must be sized \nappropriately to protect against both overloads and short circuits. If a breaker is too \nsmall for the circuit or too large to trip in time, it can cause serious issues such as \noverheating and burn marks.  \n• Electrical Faults & Protection: The standard provides detailed requirements on the \nprotection devices such as circuit breakers, fuses, and earth leakage circuit \nbreakers (ELCBs), which must be installed to prevent fire risks due to overheating \nof wiring or failure of the circuit protection devices.  \n \n4. MS 1571: 2016 – Electrical Installation Safety Standards  \nThis standard covers the general safety requirements for electrical installations, including \nprotection against electrical faults that could lead to burn marks:  \n• Circuit Breaker Safety: MS 1571 stipulates that circuit breakers should be installed \nand maintained in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The breaker \nmust be designed to protect against overcurrent and fault conditions, and if it fails \nto do so, it should be replaced immediately.  \n• Routine Maintenance: Regular maintenance and inspections are mandated to \nensure that the circuit breaker and entire electrical system function safely. Any \nsigns of burn marks or damage should be inspected by a qualified professional \nand repaired promptly.",

    "content": "Section 3.4: STORAGE OF LIQUID DRUMS WITHOUT CONTAINMENT\n\nOBSERVATION:\nThere are metal drums containing liquids (unknown liquid) being stored inside the chiller \nplant. These storage drums present potential risks related to chemical spills, leaks and \ncontamination, which could lead to safety hazards, environmental harm and operational \ndisruption.  \n \nor  \n \nThe presence of metal drums containing unknown liquids inside the chiller plant presents \nseveral potential hazards, including:  \n \nChemical spills & leaks – leading to environmental contamination and workplace \nexposure.  \nFire & explosion risk – if flammable or reactive substances are stored improperly.  \nHealth hazards – exposure to hazardous chemicals due to vapor release or direct contact.  \nOperational disruption – spills or leaks can damage surrounding equipment and cause \nsystem downtime  \n \n \nMetal drums  storage\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nTo address the risk associated with drum storage, effective spill containment measures \nare essential to prevent leaks or spills from causing safety hazards. The following steps \nshould be implemented to ensure robust spill containment.  \n \n1) Use of Spill Containment Systems  \n• Chemical drums should be stored on spill containment trays or secondary \ncontainment pallets specifically designed to capture and contain any leaks, spills, or \noverflows. These systems provide a physical barrier that prevents hazardous substances \nfrom spreading to the surrounding environment.  \n• Each containment unit must have the capacity to hold at least 110% of the largest \ndrum's volume stored on it, ensuring sufficient space for potential leaks, even in the event \nof a complete drum failure.  \n   \n2) Compatibility of Containment Materials  \n• The materials used in spill containment trays or pallets must be chemically \ncompatible with the substances being stored. For example:  \no Polyethylene pallets should be used for most corrosive chemicals, such as acids \nand bases, as they are resistant to corrosion.  \no Steel containment systems may be suitable for non -corrosive flammable liquids but \nshould not be used for acids or other corrosive substances, as this can lead to material \ndegradation.  \n• Conduct regular assessments of the compatibility between the containment \nsystems and stored chemicals to ensure long -term effectiveness.  \n \n3) Containment System Features  \n• Ensure the containment systems are equipped with raised edges or grates to keep \nthe drums elevated, preventing contact with leaked liquids and reducing the risk of further \ncorrosion or damage to the drums.  \n• Install drainage plugs or ports on the containment units to allow for safe removal of \nspilled liquids for proper disposal, in compliance with hazardous waste\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\n1. OSHA 29 CFR 1910.106(e)(2)(iii) (U.S.) – Secondary Containment for Hazardous \nSubstances  \n \nSeparation and protection. Areas in which flammable liquids are transferred from one \ntank or container to another container shall be separated from other operations in the \nbuilding by adequate distance or by construction having adequate fire resistance. \nDrainage or other means shall be provided to control spills. Adequate natural or \nmechanical ventilation shall be provided.  \n \nKey Requirement:  \n \n• Requires secondary containment systems for hazardous substances.  \n• The containment system must hold at least 110% of the volume of the largest \nstored drum.  \n• Applicable to facilities handling flammable and combustible liquids.  \n \nRecommended Implementation:  \n• Install secondary containment pallets or bunded storage for all hazardous \nsubstances.  \n• Conduct routine inspections to ensure containment integrity and capacity \ncompliance.  \n• Ensure employees are trained on proper storage, handling, and spill response.  \n \n \n2. NFPA 30 (Flammable & Combustible Liquids Code) – Fire Safety for Liquid \nStorage  \n \nChapter 9: Addresses the storage of liquids in containers, including design and \nconstruction of storage cabinets, storage arrangements, and maximum allowable \nquantities  \n \nChapter 12: Focuses on the storage of liquids in containers and portable tanks within \nstorage areas, detailing design and construction requirements for liquid storage rooms \nand warehouses.  \n \nChapter 15: Covers the storage of liquids in tanks, specifying requirements for both aboveground and underground storage tanks, including design, construction, and \ninstallation.  \n \nKey Requirement:  \n \n• Ensures flammable and combustible liquids are stored and handled safely to \nprevent fire hazards.  \n• Requires fire -rated storage cabinets and spill containment systems.  \n• Storage areas must maintain a minimum separation distance from ignition \nsources.  \n \nRecommended Implementation:  \n• Store flammable liquids in NFPA -approved fire -rated cabinets.  \n• Maintain minimum fire separation distances between storage areas and \nmachinery.  \n• Install automatic fire suppression systems in high -risk zones.  \n  \n \n 3.5 CONTAINMENT / CATCH PIT / OUTLET DISCHARGE CONTAINMENT  \nObservation  \nThe outlet discharge for the metal drums storing diesel has not been equipped with a \ncontainment system, posing a significant risk of spillage. Diesel is a flammable liquid, and \nspillage could lead to environmental contamination, fire hazards, and non -compliance with \nsafety regulations.  \n \nRecommendation  \nTo mitigate this risk, the following measures are strongly recommended:  \n \nInstall Containment for Outlet Discharge:  \nA containment system, such as a drip tray, spill pallet, or bunded platform, should be \ninstalled beneath the outlet discharge to capture any accidental leaks or spills.  \nThe containment system should be made of non -reactive, fire -resistant materials and \nsized to hold at least 110% of the maximum capacity of the largest drum in the area.  \n \nSpill Prevention Accessories:  \nEquip the outlet discharge with self -closing valves or nozzles to prevent uncontrolled flow \nof diesel during transfer operations.  \n \nRegular Inspection and Maintenance:  \nImplement a routine inspection program to ensure the containment system is in good \ncondition and free of blockages or damage.  \n \nCompliance with Regulations:  \nEnsure the containment system meets the requirements of local environmental and fire \nsafety regulations, such as NFPA 30 (Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code) or \nequivalent standards.  \nRegulation / Guideline  \nRegulations for Containment of Metal Drums Containing Diesel  \n \n1.

    "title": "STORAGE OF COMBUSTIBLE MATERIAL",
    "content": "Section 3.6: STORAGE OF COMBUSTIBLE MATERIAL\n\nOBSERVATION:\nThe storage area poses several fire safety risks due to improper arrangement. Mattresses \nand boxes are stacked in a disorganized and overcrowded manner, which can impede \nquick access to fire safety equipment and emergency exits. The lack of proper spacing \nbetween items limits ventilation, increasing the risk of heat buildup and potential fire \nignition.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nThe correct storage of combustible materials is paramount. Understanding the risks \ncombustible materials pose, and understanding how to control these risks, can help to \nprevent fires and explosions.  \n \nAs such, it is recommended that,  \n1. Proper Organization of Stored Items  \n• Proper Height and Stability: Items, especially large and bulky ones like \nmattresses, should be stacked at a safe height. Following manufacturer or \nindustry guidelines for stacking heights ensures that the structure remains \nstable and reduces the risk of items toppling over. Over stacking increases the \nchance of items falling, which can obstruct exits, cause injuries, or potentially \ntrigger a fire hazard if flammable items are involved.  \n• Secure Stacking: Items must be stacked securely using shelving units or \npallets to prevent any movement. Flammable materials should be arranged so \nthat they do not lean or shift, which could cause instability and increase the \nlikelihood of accidents.  \n• Maximize Space Efficiency: he storage area should be organized to optimize \nthe available space without overcrowding. Overcrowding creates the risk of \nblocked aisles, making it difficult for staff to access stored materials, \nemergency exits, or fire safety equipment during an emergency. Having clearly \nmarked aisles or walkways ensures that there is adequate space for personnel \nto move safely in the event of a fire.  \n \n2. Designate Fire -Safe Storage Areas  \n• Separate Combustible Materials: Materials that are highly combustible, such as \nmattresses or expanded foam should be stored in designated areas away from \nother less hazardous items. This prevents the spread of fire to non -flammable \ngoods and helps ensure that fire risks are contained in one area. In some \ncases, it may be necessary to install fire -resistant partitions or barriers to \nfurther limit the risk of fire spreading from one storage area to another. These barriers help contain a fire to a small zone, allowing staff more time to evacuate \nand control the situation.  \n• Clear Separation of Storage Zones: The storage area should be clearly marked \nto differentiate between safe and fire -hazard zones. For instance, use clearly \nvisible signage to indicate fire hazard areas where flammable materials are \nstored, and ensure these areas are kept free from unnecessary items that \ncould act as fuel in the event of a fire.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\n1. Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) 1994  \nSection 15 - Duty to Ensure Safety and Health at Work  \n• Employers' Responsibility:  Employers are required to ensure the safety, health, \nand welfare of employees at work. This includes:  \n• Ensuring that proper storage and handling of combustible materials are \nimplemented to avoid risk to employees.  \n• Providing safe working conditions, which include safe storage for \nhazardous materials.  \nSection 24 - Reporting of Dangerous Occurrences  \n• Any dangerous occurrences involving combustible materials must be reported to \nthe Department of Occupational Safety and Health (DOSH) immediately.  \n \n2. Fire Services Act 1988  \nThe Fire Services Act 1988  governs fire safety in Malaysia, including the storage of \ncombustible materials.  \nSection 10 - Fire Prevention  \n• Fire Safety Measures: All premises where combustible materials are stored must \nhave proper fire prevention measures. This includes:  \n• Installation of fire alarms, sprinkler systems, and fire extinguishers.  \n• Ensuring that the building’s fire protection system is maintained and \noperational.  \nSection 11 - Fire Risk Assessment  \n• A Fire Risk Assessment  must be conducted to evaluate the risks associated with \nstoring combustible materials.  \n• Identifying fire hazards, including ignition sources, and assessing whether \ncombustible materials are stored in a way that could cause fires.  \nSection 12 - Fire Safety in Buildings  \n• For buildings storing combustible materials, specific fire safety measures must be \nfollowed:  \n• The building must be designed to prevent the spread of fire.  \n• Materials must be separated and stored in appropriate fire -rated rooms or \nareas.  \nSection 14 - Fire Protection Plans  \n• Fire protection plans must be prepared for premises that store combustible \nmaterials.  \n• The plans should detail evacuation routes, emergency exits, and the \nlocation of fire -fighting equipment.  \n \n3. Uniform Building By -Law (UBBL) 1984  \nThe Uniform Building By -Law (UBBL) 1984  provides detailed regulations regarding the \nconstruction and maintenance of buildings, including provisions for fire safety and the \nstorage of hazardous materials.  \nPart 7 – Fire Protection and Safety  \nThis section details the design, construction, and fire safety measures for buildings, \nparticularly those storing combustible materials.  Section 147 - Fire Compartments and Fire -Resistant Structures  \n• Fire-Rated Compartmentalization: Areas where combustible materials are stored \nshould be compartmentalized to prevent the spread of fire. These compartments \nmust be constructed using fire -resistant materials.  \n• Fireproof Doors and Partitions: Fireproof doors, windows, and partitions must be \nused to separate storage areas from other parts of the building.  \nSection 148 - Storage of Combustible Materials  \n• Storage Requirements: Combustible materials must be stored in a manner that \nminimizes the risk of fire. This includes:  \n• Ensuring adequate ventilation to avoid the accumulation of flammable \ngases.  \n• Storing materials at a safe distance from ignition sources.  \n• Regular maintenance to prevent the buildup of combustible dust or other \nmaterials that may contribute to fire risks.  \nSection 149 - Emergency Exits and Evacuation Routes  \n• Evacuation Routes: Buildings storing combustible materials must have clearly \nmarked and accessible evacuation routes to allow quick evacuation in the event of \na fire.  \n• Exit Doors: Emergency exit doors should be fire -resistant and wide enough to \naccommodate quick evacuation.",

    "content": "Section 4.3: HOT WORK\n\nOBSERVATION:\nHot work  permit scheme is not adopted in the risk.  \n \nThe absence of a Hot Work Permit Scheme in the facility introduces significant fire and \nexplosion risks during hot work operations, such as welding, cutting, or the use of \nequipment that generates heat or naked flames. Among hazards from hot work activities \nare fire hazards, explosion and safety hazards.  \n \nFire Hazard  \n - Hot work generates sparks, heat, or open flames, which can easily ignite flammable \nmaterials, oils, gases, or dust present in the work area.  \nFires originating from hot work activities have been known to spread rapidly, causing \nextensive property damage and potential loss of life.  \n \nExplosion Risks:  \n - The presence of flammable vapours  or gases in poorly ventilated areas increases the \nlikelihood of explosions during hot work.  \n \nSafety Hazards:  \n - Lack of controls can lead to unsafe working conditions, putting employees and \ncontractors at significant risk of injury or fatalities.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nTo mitigate these risks and align with best practices, it is strongly recommended that the \ninsured adopt a formal Hot Work Permit System. This system is designed to establish \ncontrol measures for hot work activities, ensuring that potential hazards are identified and \nmitigated before, during, and after operations.  \n \nA formal Hot Work Permit System shall consider the followings key elements:  \n1. Permit Issuance Process  \no A hot work permit is a documented authorization that allows specific hot \nwork to be carried out in designated or temporary areas.  \no The permit is issued by a responsible authority, such as a safety officer or \nsupervisor, after assessing the risks and ensuring all safety precautions are \nin place.  \n2. Pre-Work Risk Assessment  \no Evaluate the work area for fire hazards, such as combustible materials, \nflammable liquids, and potential ignition sources.  \no Assess whether hot work can be avoided by using alternative methods \n(e.g., mechanical fasteners instead of welding).  \n3. Control Measures and Precautions  \no Fire Watch:  Assign a trained fire watch person to monitor the area during \nand after the work.  \no Isolation of Hazards:  Remove flammable materials or shield them with \nfire-resistant barriers.  \no Ventilation:  Ensure adequate ventilation to prevent the accumulation of \nflammable gases or vapours . \no Fire-Extinguishing Equipment:  Provide readily accessible fire \nextinguishers and other fire -suppression tools.  \no Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):  Workers should wear appropriate \nPPE, such as fire -resistant clothing, gloves, goggles, and helmets.  \n4. Documentation and Record -Keeping  \no Maintain a written record of all hot work permits issued, including the work location, time, nature of the work, and safety measures implemented.  \no The permit should also include details of the fire watch duration and post -\nwork inspection results.  \n5. Post -Work Inspection  \no Conduct a thorough inspection of the work area after the hot work is \ncompleted to ensure no residual heat, sparks, or smoldering materials \nremain.  \no Typically, a fire watch should continue for a specified duration (e.g., 30 -60 \nminutes) after the work ends.  \n6. Employee Training and Competence  \no Train all personnel involved in hot work activities and those responsible for \noverseeing the permit system.  \no Training should cover fire risks, control measures, the proper use of \nequipment, and emergency response protocols.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\nOccupational Safety and Health Act 1994 (OSHA 1994):  \n \nSection 15 - General Duties of Employers and Self -Employed Persons to Their \nEmployees:  \nEmployers are required to ensure, so far as is practicable, the safety, health, and welfare \nat work of all their employees.  \nThis includes providing and maintaining a safe working environment without risks to \nhealth, which encompasses controlling hazards associated with hot work activities.  \n \nSection 15: General Duties of Employers  \nThis section mandates employers to ensure the safety, health, and welfare of employees \nat work as far as is practicable. Implementing a Hot Work Permit System satisfies this duty \nby: \n \n4. Hazard Identification and Control:  \nThe permit system requires a comprehensive risk assessment to identify hazards \nassociated with hot work (e.g., sparks, open flames, and heat generation).  \nControl measures, such as removing flammable materials, providing fire extinguishers, \nand ensuring proper ventilation, mitigate risks before the work begins.  \n \n5. Safe Work Systems:  \nA Hot Work Permit System establishes a structured and documented process for \nmanaging hot work operations, ensuring safety protocols are consistently followed.  \n \nSection 16: Duty to Formulate a Safe Work System  \nEmployers are required to establish and maintain systems of work that are safe and \nwithout risks to health. A Hot Work Permit System fulfils  this requirement through:  \n \na) Pre-Work Authorization:  \nNo hot work activity can proceed without prior authorization from the designated safety \nofficer or Factory Manager, ensuring that all safety measures are in place.  \n \nb) Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):  \nThe system enforces SOPs for hot work activities, such as inspection of the work area, fire \nwatch assignments, and post -work monitoring.  \n \nSection 17: General Duties of Employers and Self -Employed Persons  \nThis section applies to ensuring the safety of non -employees (e.g., contractors, visitors) \naffected by workplace activities. A Hot Work Permit System ensures:  \n a) Control of Third -Party Activities:  \nContractors performing hot work must obtain permits and adhere to the same safety \nrequirements, ensuring a uniform standard across the workplace.  \n \nb) Minimization of Risks to Surrounding Areas:  \nThe permit system extends safety precautions to areas adjacent to hot work operations, \nreducing risks to non -participants.  \n \nc) Training and Awareness:  \nEmployers are obligated to provide training and resources to employees. The Hot Work \nPermit System includes educating workers and contractors on safe hot work practices and \nthe importance of obtaining permits.",

    "content": "Section 4.7: SMOKING POLICY NOT ENFORCED\n\nOBSERVATION:\nSmoking has been identified as one of the top ten sources of ignition, making it a leading \ncause of fires globally. This risk becomes significantly heightened in high -hazard areas \nwhere flammable liquids, gases, or large quantities of combustible materials are stored or \nprocessed. Carelessly discarded cigarettes, matches, or smoking materials can smolder \nundetected, often leading to fully developed fires that can cause extensive damage before \nbeing discovered.  \n \nTo address this risk effectively and align with regulatory and industry standards, it is \nessential to implement and enforce a robust smoking policy.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nTo mitigate the risks associated with smoking, the following measures are strongly \nrecommended:  \n \n1. Smoking Prohibition in High -Risk Areas  \nSmoking should be strictly prohibited in all areas of the facility where flammable or \ncombustible materials are present, including:  \n- Storage areas for flammable liquids and gases.  \n- Processing zones handling combustible materials.  \n- Warehouses, laboratories, and confined spaces where fire hazards exist.  \n \n2. Development of a Comprehensive Smoking Policy  \nEstablish a formal smoking policy that clearly defines:  \n- Areas where smoking is prohibited.  \n- The location and management of designated smoking areas (if applicable).  \n- Enforcement measures for non -compliance.  \n- Ensure the policy includes basic smoking safeguards such as proper disposal \nmethods for smoking materials (e.g., fire -safe receptacles).  \n \n3. Effective Communication of the Smoking Policy  \nThe smoking policy should be communicated effectively to all levels of employees, \ncontractors, visitors, and other stakeholders. This can be achieved through:  \n- Safety briefings and orientations.  \n- Signage and written materials.  \n- Digital communication platforms (e.g., emails, intranet postings).  \n- Special attention should be given to ensuring language and literacy considerations \nare addressed so the policy is clearly understood by all.  \n \n4. Provision of Clear and Visible Signage  \nInstall prominent and visible signage at strategic locations within the facility, including:  \n- Entrances, exits, and common areas.  \n- High-hazard zones.  \n- Designated smoking areas (if applicable).  \n- Examples of signage include:  \n- “Strictly No Smoking\" signs for prohibited areas.  \n- \"Designated Smoking Area\" signs for controlled smoking zones.  \n \n5. Designation of Safe Smoking Areas (If Smoking is Permitted)  \nDesignate specific areas for smoking that are:  \n- Located a safe distance from high -risk zones.  \n- Equipped with fire -safe ashtrays or receptacles for proper disposal of cigarette \nbutts and matches.  \n- Clearly marked and easily accessible.   \n6. Regular Monitoring and Enforcement  \n- Conduct regular inspections to ensure compliance with the smoking policy.  \n- Assign personnel (e.g., safety officers or supervisors) to monitor adherence and address \nviolations promptly.  \n- Establish and communicate penalties for non -compliance to deter breaches of the policy.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\n1. NFPA Standards (National Fire Protection Association)  \n \nNFPA 101: Life Safety Code mandates fire safety measures, including smoking \nrestrictions, in various facilities.  \nNFPA 10: Standard for Portable Fire Extinguishers emphasizes the importance of \nreducing ignition sources such as smoking in fire -prone zones.  \n \n2. OSHA 1994  \n \n1. General Duties of Employers  \nUnder Section 15 of OSHA 1994, employers are required to:  \n- Ensure, so far as is practicable, the safety, health, and welfare of employees at \nwork.  \n- Provide a safe working environment, which includes controlling fire hazards like \nsmoking in high -risk areas.  \n \nApplication to Smoking Policy:  \n- Smoking poses fire risks, especially in workplaces with flammable substances or \nmaterials.  \n- Employers must establish and enforce a smoking policy to eliminate or minimize \nthis risk.  \n- They are also responsible for ensuring that all employees are informed about the \nsmoking restrictions.  \n \n2. Control of Workplace Hazards  \nUnder Section 16 of OSHA 1994, employers must formulate and implement a safety and \nhealth policy. This includes addressing workplace hazards like smoking.  \n \nApplication to Smoking Policy:  \n- The smoking policy should be part of the overall safety and health policy.  \n- It should identify areas where smoking is prohibited, such as:  \n- Storage areas for flammable materials.  \n- Areas with high concentrations of combustible materials.  \n- Employers must also implement measures like signage, designated smoking areas \n(if allowed), and fire -safe disposal receptacles.",

If flammable liquid maintains \nto be stored in the existing location, provision must be made to relocate it to the far \ncorner of the building with one hour fire rated partition to cut -off the flammable \nliquid occupancy from surrounding occupancies.  \n• Ventilation is provided for the room in the form of gravity or a mechanical exhaust \nventilation system designed to provide a complete change of air in the room and \nthe vapor or concentration in the room should be maintained below 25% of the \nlower flammability level. The ventilation for flammable liquids is recommended to \nbe installed at low -level because flammable vapor is heavier than air and \ntherefore, it settles to the ground level.  \n• To contain the flammable liquids from approaching other properties, a containment \nsystem should be constructed to permit safe collection of spillage or leakage. The \nsize of containment should be able to accommodate the largest container stored.  \n• The quantity of flammable liquids kept in the production area must strictly limit \nmerely for daily consumption. Any balance must be returned back to the \ndesignated storeroom  or kept in the approved flammable cabinet (as per photo \nbelow).  \n \nAlternatively, the spray painting activity could be carried out outside the building away \nfrom any combustible materials.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\n1. Fire Services Act 1988 (Act 341)  \nThe Fire Services Act 1988  is the primary legislative framework governing fire safety in \nMalaysia. Key provisions include:  \n• Section 8: Abatement of Fire Hazards  \n• Authorities, such as the Director General of Fire Services, have the power \nto issue notices requiring premises to rectify fire hazards.  \n• Improper storage or handling of flammable substances (e.g., spray paints) \nthat pose a fire risk can lead to such notices.  \n• Failure to comply with these notices can result in fines or prosecution.  \n• Section 23: Installation of Fire Safety Systems  \n• Owners of premises where flammable substances are used or stored must \nensure appropriate fire safety systems, such as fire extinguishers and \nsuppression systems, are installed.  \n \n2. Uniform Building By -Laws (UBBL) 1984  \nThe UBBL  is Malaysia’s building regulation framework and includes fire safety provisions \nthat apply to all buildings, including those handling hazardous materials. Relevant sections \ninclude:  \n• Regulation 225: Storage of Dangerous Goods  \n• Flammable and combustible materials must be stored in designated areas \naway from public spaces.  \n• Proper ventilation must be installed to prevent the accumulation of \nhazardous vapours . \n• Regulation 247: Fire Extinguishing Appliances  \n• Fire extinguishers must be provided at accessible locations.  \n• Equipment must comply with standards set by the Malaysian Fire and \nRescue Department.  \n \n3. Department of Occupational Safety and Health (DOSH) Guidelines  \nThe Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994  and associated guidelines from DOSH \nemphasize safe handling, storage, and use of hazardous chemicals:  \n• Chemical Safety Guidelines:  \n• Employers are required to identify hazards and ensure that flammable \nmaterials like spray paints are stored in fire -resistant cabinets.  \n• Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) must be provided for all hazardous \nsubstances and accessible to employees.  \n• Control of Industrial Major Accident Hazards (CIMAH) Regulations 1996:  \n• Requires facilities that store flammable chemicals to conduct risk \nassessments and implement measures to mitigate potential fire hazards .  \n4. Malaysian Standards (MS)  \nThe Malaysian Standards  provide technical requirements for fire safety equipment and \ninstallations. Notable standards include:  \n• MS 1539:2002 – Portable Fire Extinguishers:  \n• Specifies the types of fire extinguishers suitable for different classes of fire, \nincluding Class B (flammable liquids).  \n• MS 830:1983 – Ventilation Systems for Hazardous Areas:  \nProvides guidelines for proper ventilation systems to reduce the risk of flammable vapor \naccumulation.",

    "title": "THICKNESS TESTING OF BULK TANKS",
    "content": "Section 5.7: THICKNESS TESTING OF BULK TANKS\n\nOBSERVATION:\nThe bulking facilities have been operating since 2008, but the thickness test for the tanks \nhas not been conducted since the start of operations.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nThe thickness testing of bulk storage tanks is conducted to assess the condition and \nintegrity of the tank's structure. This test ensures that the tank's walls, particularly the \nbottom and shell, are still thick enough to withstand the operational pressures and are \nsafe for continued use. The testing is typically performed on above -ground storage tanks \nused for petroleum, chemicals, and other bulk liquids.  \n \nIt is recommended that a thickness test for the tanks be conducted promptly to assess \ntheir structural integrity and ensure continued safe operation. Moving forward, thickness \ntesting should be scheduled based on industry standards as follows:  \n \n• Initial Test: To be conducted immediately to establish the current condition of the \ntanks.  \n \n• Subsequent Tests: Thickness tests should be carried out every 5 years in \naccordance with standard industry practices (e.g., API 653 for storage tanks).  \n \n• Additional Testing: If any significant corrosion or structural issues are identified, \nadditional tests should be scheduled based on the severity of the findings and the \nrecommendations from the inspection report.  \n \nThis approach will help prevent potential failures and maintain compliance with safety \nstandards.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\nEnsuring the structural integrity and safety of storage tanks is paramount in industrial \noperations. Several standards and guidelines govern the inspection, maintenance, and \nrepair of these tanks. Below is an overview of key international and Malaysian standards.  \n \n1. API 650 (American Petroleum Institute ) - Welded Tanks for Oil Storage  \n• Scope: API 650 provides the standards for the design, fabrication, and inspection \nof welded steel tanks for the storage of petroleum and other liquids, which includes \npalm oil.  \n• Relevance: This standard is widely used for bulk storage tanks, including palm oil \ntanks, as it specifies the minimum requirements for the tank's material, design, \nconstruction, and safety. For palm oil tanks, particularly those storing crude palm \noil or refined palm oil, API 650 ensures that the tank is designed to withstand the \ninternal pressures, temperatures, and other mechanical stresses while maintaining \nstructural integrity over time.  \n• Design Criteria:  \no Material Selection: The material must be compatible with the chemical \nproperties of the stored liquid (e.g., palm oil).  \no Thickness of Tank Shell and Bottom: The standard specifies calculations for \ndetermining the minimum thickness based on the size, pressure, and type of liquid being stored.  \no Corrosion Allowance: A corrosion allowance is typically added to ensure the \ntank maintains integrity over its service life, particularly at the bottom where \nwater accumulation and contamination might accelerate corrosion.  \n \n• Inspection & Maintenance:  \no API 650 requires regular inspections of tanks, including ultrasonic thickness \nmeasurements and visual inspections, to identify areas of corrosion or \nthinning.  \no It also recommends periodic hydrostatic testing (filling the tank with water \nto check for leaks), especially after repairs or modifications.  \n• Acceptance Criteria:  \no If the thickness of the tank wall falls below the allowable thickness defined \nby the design, repairs or replacement of the affected section are required.  \n \n2. API 653 (American Petroleum Institute)  - Tank Inspection, Repair, Alteration, and \nReconstruction  \n• Scope: API 653 deals specifically with the inspection, repair, and maintenance of \nabove -ground storage tanks (ASTs). It is directly applicable to bulk storage tanks \nused for palm oil.  \n• Relevance: This standard is used once a storage tank is in service and needs \nongoing inspection and maintenance. It complements API 650 by providing specific \nguidance for post -construction activities.  \n• Inspection & Maintenance:  \no Ultrasonic Thickness Testing: API 653 provides guidelines on when and \nhow to perform thickness testing to assess the level of corrosion, especially \nat critical points like the tank bottom and welds.  \no Tank Cleaning: Palm oil tanks need to be cleaned regularly to remove \nsediment and microbial growth, especially at the tank bottom where water \nand oil residue can accumulate.  \no Repair and Alteration: If corrosion or thinning exceeds allowable limits, the \ntank may require repair or alteration, such as replacing corroded plates or \nadding reinforcement.  \n• Structural Integrity: API 653 requires the tank to undergo a comprehensive \ninspection, including checking for leakages, deformation, and any signs of \noverstress. Tanks with significant corrosion or defects should be derated (used \nunder lower operating conditions) until repairs are made.  \n \n3. MS 1984: Part 2  - Storage Tanks for Petroleum Products and Other Liquids (Malaysian \nStandard)  \n• Scope: This standard, aligned with API 650, is the Malaysian Standard for \ndesigning, constructing, and maintaining storage tanks for various liquids, including \npalm oil.  \n• Relevance: MS 1984 Part 2 applies to storage tanks for liquids like palm oil and \nsets the local benchmarks for tank construction, safety, and inspections. It ensures \nthat tanks meet both local regulations and international standards.  \n• Design Requirements:  \no Corrosion Allowance: The standard requires a corrosion allowance for the \ntank shell and bottom to accommodate the effects of palm oil's chemical \ncomposition, especially free fatty acids (FFAs) and moisture that may \naccelerate corrosion.  \no Seismic and Wind Load Considerations: As Malaysia is prone to tropical storms, MS 1984 includes guidelines for tanks to withstand high winds, \nespecially if the tanks are located in areas susceptible to such conditions.  \n• Inspection and Maintenance:  \no Similar to API 650, this standard recommends periodic thickness \nmeasurements and visual inspections.  \no Leak testing and structural checks are mandatory as part of tank \ninspections to ensure there are no cracks or potential leaks, especially \nwhen the tank is storing edible products like palm oil.  \n \n4. ASME  (American Society of Mechanical Engineers)  - Boiler and Pressure Vessel \nCode  \n• Scope: ASME standards are used for pressure vessels and other tanks that \noperate under pressure. While this is not always directly applicable to storage \ntanks, certain types of palm oil storage tanks that are pressurized or have heating \nsystems (e.g., for crude palm oil storage) may follow these standards.  \n• Relevance: If the storage tank is designed to withstand internal pressures (such as \nhigh-temperature crude palm oil storage), ASME standards will apply to ensure the \ntank can withstand operational stresses without failure.  \n• Design Criteria:  \no The ASME code will specify material strength, corrosion allowances, and \npressure relief requirements for tanks operating at elevated temperatures \nor pressures.  \n• Inspection and Testing:  \no For pressurized tanks, ASME standards require pressure testing to ensure \nstructural integrity.  \no Ultrasonic testing and radiographic testing may be used to check welds and \nareas subject to fatigue or corrosion.  \n \n5. DOSH (Department of Occupational Safety and Health, Malaysia)  Regulations  \n• Scope: DOSH regulations govern safety in the workplace and apply to the \noperation and maintenance of storage tanks used in Malaysia. These regulations \nensure that workers are not exposed to unsafe working conditions while \ninspecting, maintaining, or repairing storage tanks.  \n• Relevance: These regulations ensure that palm oil storage tank operations are \ncarried out in a safe manner, especially in terms of confined space entry, spill \ncontainment, and fire safety.  \n• Inspection & Maintenance:  \no Tanks must comply with DOSH safety guidelines when it comes to entering \nconfined spaces (tank interiors), and appropriate gas testing is required \nbefore entry.  \no Tanks must be properly maintained to prevent leaks, which could result in \nenvironmental hazards or accidents.  \n \n6. ISO 9001: Quality Management Systems  \n• Scope: ISO 9001 is a globally recognized standard for quality management \nsystems (QMS). Though it is not directly related to tank design, it plays an \nimportant role in ensuring that the maintenance and inspection processes for \nstorage tanks follow a standardized procedure.  \n• Relevance: Compliance with ISO 9001 ensures that tank maintenance procedures \nare consistent and well -documented, which is vital for ensuring the reliability and \nsafety of palm oil storage tanks.  \n• Inspection & Documentation:  o Maintenance, inspections, and repairs must be documented and follow a \nquality control process to ensure consistent performance and traceability of \nall tank -related activities.",

    "title": "TEMPERATURE MONITORING FOR PALM KERNEL STORAGE",
    "content": "Section 5.8: TEMPERATURE MONITORING FOR PALM KERNEL STORAGE\n\nOBSERVATION:\nThe risk is provided with two units of palm kernel silos, and sometimes the palm kernel is \nstored in the warehouse during peak production periods. It was noted that both the kernel \nsilo and pile storage are not equipped with temperature monitoring.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nPalm kernels, though not as volatile as crude palm oil, can still pose a fire risk under \ncertain conditions. Some of the factors contributing to fire risks in palm kernel storage are:  \n \n• Oily nature of palm kernels: The kernels contain natural oils, which are flammable \nunder the right conditions, especially when exposed to high temperatures or \nimproper storage conditions.  \n• Dust accumulation: The dust generated from processing palm kernels can be \nhighly flammable and pose an explosion risk when mixed with air.  \n• Spontaneous combustion: Spontaneous combustion can occur if palm kernels or \nother organic materials like fibre are stored in poorly ventilated conditions. The \ninternal heat generated from biological decomposition or oxidation of the oil may \nlead to a fire.  \n \nTo mitigate the risk of fire hazards and spontaneous combustion, it is recommended to \ninstall a comprehensive temperature monitoring system for both palm kernel silos and pile \nstorage. Palm kernels are prone to spontaneous combustion due to their oily nature and \nthe buildup of heat from biological activity and oxidation. Installing continuous temperature \nmonitoring with sensors placed at multiple levels within the silo and across different areas \nof the pile storage will help detect abnormal temperature increases early. High -\ntemperature alarms should be integrated with the plant's control system to trigger an \nautomatic response if temperatures exceed safe limits (typically 45°C to 50°C). The \nmonitoring system should provide real -time data logging and remote access to allow for \nquick intervention. Regular calibration and maintenance of the sensors should be included \nin the maintenance program to ensure accuracy and reliability. Implementing this system \nwill improve safety, prevent product loss, and enhance overall operational efficiency\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\n1. MSPO (Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil) Standard  \nThe MSPO certification is the national standard for sustainable palm oil production in \nMalaysia. It ensures that palm oil production complies with environmental, social, and \neconomic criteria. While MSPO does not explicitly require temperature monitoring for \npalm kernel storage , it emphasizes the importance of good agricultural practices  \n(GAP) and overall sustainability, which includes proper handling and storage of palm \nproducts.  \n \nRelevant MSPO Principles and Criteria Related to Temperature Monitoring  \n• Principle 3: Social Responsibility, Health, Safety, and Employment  \no MSPO emphasizes the health and safety of workers, which can include \nensuring that palm oil storage conditions are safe and that the environment \naround the storage is non -hazardous. Proper temperature control in \nstorage areas is one way to ensure the safety and quality of stored palm \nkernels, as poorly controlled temperature can lead to spoilage or \ncontamination that may compromise worker safety.  \n• Principle 4: Environmental Responsibility and Conservation of Natural Resources  and Biodiversity   \no This principle stresses the need for responsible environmental practices \nthat prevent harm to natural resources. In the context of palm kernel \nstorage, environmental responsibility would include maintaining proper \ntemperature control to prevent spoilage or decomposition, which could lead \nto waste, environmental contamination, or unnecessary disposal of \nproducts.  \n• Principle 5: Best Practices  \no MSPO stresses the importance of following best practices throughout the \nproduction and processing phases, including the storage of palm products. \nTemperature control would be considered part of these best practices in the \nhandling and storage of palm kernels to ensure that the product remains of \nhigh quality.  \n• Traceability and Record -Keeping:  \no MSPO requires producers to maintain records that demonstrate traceability \nof the palm oil products from farm to mill and ultimately to the consumer. \nThis includes ensuring that palm kernels are stored in a controlled \nenvironment. Monitoring temperature in the storage process could form \npart of the documentation and record -keeping practices, which ensures that \npalm kernels are stored at appropriate conditions throughout the entire \nsupply chain.  \n \nMSPO Guidelines on Storage Conditions  \n• While MSPO does not have a dedicated temperature monitoring requirement for \npalm kernel storage, it does require proper storage conditions to avoid \ndegradation. Storing palm kernels at proper temperatures (around 25 -30°C) is \nessential to preserve their quality and prevent rancidity, mold growth, or insect \ninfestations.  \n• For sustainability, palm oil processors must ensure that storage practices do not \nnegatively impact the environment. Ventilated storage areas and appropriate \ntemperature monitoring systems help mitigate negative impacts such as spoilage \nor unnecessary waste.  \n \n2. RSPO (Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil) Standard  \nThe RSPO  is an international certification system that promotes the production and use of \nsustainable palm oil. It sets criteria for environmental, social, and economic sustainability, \nincluding the handling, storage, and transportation of palm oil products. Like MSPO, \nRSPO does not explicitly mandate temperature monitoring for palm kernel storage, but it \nemphasizes good manufacturing practices (GMP) and the maintenance of quality \nthroughout the supply chain.  \nRelevant RSPO Principles and Criteria Related to Temperature Monitoring  \n \n• Principle 4: Use of Appropriate Best Practices by Growers and Millers  \no RSPO requires that palm oil mills and storage facilities implement best \npractices for palm oil production and processing. This includes the handling \nand storage of palm oil products such as palm kernels. Temperature control \nis considered part of good practice because it ensures that palm kernels do \nnot spoil or degrade, preserving the quality and sustainability of the \nproduct.  \n• Principle 5: Environmental Responsibility and Conservation of Natural Resources \nand Biodiversity  \no RSPO requires that palm oil producers minimize waste and optimize resource use. Proper storage conditions —such as maintaining the right \ntemperature for palm kernels —help reduce spoilage, waste, and loss of \nproduct. This aligns with the RSPO's commitment to reducing \nenvironmental impact and optimizing the use of natural resources in palm \noil production.  \n• Principle 7: Responsible Development of New Plantings  \no RSPO certification ensures traceability throughout the palm oil supply \nchain, which includes monitoring the quality and storage conditions of \nproducts. Proper temperature control is one aspect of ensuring traceability, \nas maintaining product quality during storage is essential for ensuring that it \nmeets the sustainability and quality criteria required for RSPO certification.  \n \nRSPO Guidelines on Storage Conditions and Temperature Control  \n• Temperature control is part of the good manufacturing practices (GMP ) that RSPO \npromotes. The guidelines emphasize the importance of ventilation, cooling, and \nproper handling of palm oil products, including palm kernels, to ensure they remain \nin good condition.  \n• Best practices for palm kernel storage include:  \no Ensuring cool and dry storage conditions to prevent oxidation, fungal \ngrowth, or insect infestations.  \no Monitoring the temperature and humidity of storage areas to ensure the \nproduct is maintained within the ideal range (typically 25 -30°C for palm \nkernels) to avoid spoilage.  \n• Traceability is another key element in the RSPO certification process. The \nstandard encourages the monitoring and documentation of storage conditions, \nincluding temperature logging, to ensure that products are stored correctly, and \ntheir quality is maintained from the point of production to distribution.  \n \n3. Industry Best Practices for Temperature Control in Palm Kernel Storage  \nWhile MSPO and RSPO do not mandate temperature monitoring in detail for palm kernel \nstorage, industry best practices are often followed in compliance with the broader \nsustainability and quality guidelines provided by these certifications. Some of these best \npractices include:  \n• Temperature Range:  \no Palm kernels should ideally be stored at ambient temperatures between \n25-30°C. If stored at higher temperatures, kernels may undergo oxidation, \nleading to rancidity and quality loss.  \n• Ventilated Storage:  \no Proper ventilation is critical in controlling both temperature and humidity. \nPoor ventilation can lead to moisture buildup, which increases the risk of \nmold growth and spoilage.  \n• Temperature Monitoring Systems:  \no Automated temperature control systems and monitoring devices are \nincreasingly used in storage facilities. These systems include sensors to \ntrack temperature fluctuations and alarms to signal when temperatures fall \noutside acceptable ranges.  \n• Regular Monitoring and Record Keeping:  \no Temperature logs are often maintained as part of traceability efforts. These \nlogs record the temperature conditions of storage areas at regular intervals \nand help ensure compliance with sustainability standards and industry \nnorms.  \n• Monitoring of Humidity:  o In addition to temperature, humidity is another critical factor in palm kernel \nstorage. High humidity can lead to mold  growth and fungal contamination. \nProper moisture control can prevent the kernels from degrading and ensure \nthey remain in good condition.",

    "title": "TANK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM",
    "content": "Section 5.9: TANK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nOBSERVATION:\nThere is no proper tank management program adopted by the insured.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nA Tank Management Program (TMP) is a structured approach to managing storage tanks, \nensuring their integrity, safety, and operational efficiency through proper design, \nconstruction, inspection, maintenance, and repair. Various international and Malaysian \nstandards provide detailed guidelines to regulate the management of storage tanks, \nincluding material selection, thickness testing, fire safety, and environmental protection.  \n \nA comprehensive Tank Management Program (TMP) is essential to ensure the integrity, \nsafety, and operational efficiency of storage tanks. The program should cover tank design \nand construction following API 650 and BS 2654 standards, ensuring minimum shell \nthickness of 6 mm and proper foundation design to handle structural loads. Regular \ninspections are crucial, with external and ultrasonic thickness testing (UTT) conducted \nevery 5 years and internal inspections every 10 years, as per API 653 and MS 2523. \nCorrosion control measures, including protective coatings and cathodic protection, should \nbe implemented to prevent metal thinning. Repairs and alterations must comply with API \n653 guidelines, with weld repairs subjected to non -destructive testing (NDT). Operational \nmeasures, such as continuous pressure and temperature monitoring, emergency venting, \nand overpressure protection, should align with API 620 and BS 2654 requirements. Proper \ndocumentation of inspections, repairs, and thickness measurements should be \nmaintained, while trained and certified personnel should oversee TMP implementation to \nensure compliance and enhance safety and efficiency.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\nThe most relevant standards related to Tank Management Programs (TMP) primarily focus \non the design, construction, inspection, maintenance, and repair of storage tanks. Below \nare the key standards, including their timeline requirements and technical aspects such as \nallowable thickness, inspection intervals, and other operational parameters:  \n \n1. API 650 – Welded Tanks for Oil Storage  \nScope and Purpose  \nAPI 650 is the key standard for the design and construction of new welded storage tanks \nfor oil and petroleum products. It covers tanks with internal pressures up to 2.5 psi and \noperating temperatures betwee n −40°F and 500°F.  \n \nKey Technical Aspects  \n• Tank Material and Thickness:  \no Minimum thickness for carbon steel: 1/4 inch (6.35 mm).  \no Tanks with diameters greater than 15 m should have a minimum shell \nthickness of 6 mm.  \no Corrosion allowance should be added based o n service conditions.  \n \n• Design Requirements:  \no Allowable stress limits for different materials based on operating pressure \nand temperature.  \no Wind and seismic load considerations.  \no Annular plates required for tanks greater than 30 m in diameter.  \n • Inspection Requirements:  \no Shell and bottom thickness must be measured during construction.  \no Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) of welds (ultrasonic, radiographic) is \nmandatory.  \n \nTimeline for Inspection and Testing  \nActivity  Frequency  Details  \nVisual Inspection  Monthly  External check for leaks, \ncorrosion, and structural integrity.  \nUltrasonic \nThickness Test \n(UTT)  Every 5 years (or more often \nbased on corrosion rate)  Evaluate corrosion rate and \nremaining thickness.  \nInternal Inspection  Every 10 years  Comprehensive inspection of \nshell, bottom, and roof.  \nHydrostatic Test  After construction or major \nrepair  Hold for 24 hours, test pressure at \n1.25x design pressure.  \n \n2. API 653 – Tank Inspection, Repair, Alteration, and Reconstruction  \nScope and Purpose  \nAPI 653 governs the inspection, repair, alteration, and reconstruction of existing tanks built \nto API 650 or similar standards. It ensures that tanks remain fit for service over their \nlifetime.  \nKey Technical Aspects  \n• Minimum Shell Thickness:  \no For tanks over 30 m in diameter: Minimum shell thickness = 6 mm.  \no Minimum bottom plate thickness = 6 mm.  \n \n• Corrosion Rate Calculation:  \no Corrosion rate = (Original thickness - Current thickness) ÷ Years of service.  \no Minimum acceptable shell thickness should not fall below calculated \nminimum based on stress limits.  \n \n• Repair Guidelines:  \no If thickness is below minimum, plate replacement or weld overlay is \nrequired.  \no Bottom patching allowed if patch overlaps extend at least 50 mm beyond \nthe thinned area.  \n \n• Weld Quality and Inspection:  \no NDT (radiography and ultrasonic) required for weld joints.  \no Weld repairs must follow pre -approved welding procedures.  \n \nTimeline for Inspection and Testing  \nActivity  Frequency  Details  \nExternal Inspection  Every 5 years  Visual inspection of shell, roof, \nnozzles, and foundation.  \nUltrasonic Thickness \nTest (UTT)  Every 5 years (or based on \ncorrosion rate)  Shell, roof, and bottom thickness \nmeasurements.  \nInternal Inspection  Every 10 years  Detailed check of bottom and \ninternal surfaces.

    "content": "Section 5.10: WEIR INTEGRITY TESTING\n\nOBSERVATION:\nCurrently, weir inspection and integrity testing are not conducted as part of preventive \nmaintenance for mini hydroelectric.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nWeirs require regular integrity testing as part of maintenance and safety protocols to \nensure structural stability and hydraulic efficiency. A weir, constructed across a river or \nstream to regulate water flow or raise water levels, is a critical component of flood control, \nflow measurement, and water management infrastructure.  \n \nAs such, an integrity testing should be incorporated into the preventive maintenance \nprogram for the mini hydroelectric.  Integrity testing should include detailed structural \ninspections to identify cracks, deformation, and material degradation using visual methods \nand non -destructive testing (NDT) techniques such as ultrasonic testing (UT) and acoustic \nemission testing (AET) to detect internal defects and voids. Seepage monitoring should be \nconducted using piezometers to measure pore water pressure and identify seepage paths \nthrough the structure or foundation. Dye tracing can be employed to map leakage patterns \nand identify failure points. Hydraulic performance evaluation should involve stage -\ndischarge analysis and flow rating measurements to confirm the weir's discharge capacity \nunder varying hydraulic loads. Sedimentation surveys using sonar or echo sounders \nshould be performed to monitor sediment accumulation that could reduce flow efficiency. \nErosion monitoring should include scour depth measurements and geotechnical \nassessments at the crest, spillway, and downstream apron to detect undercutting and soil \ninstability. For mechanically operated weirs, functional testing of gates, valves, and \nactuators should be performed, including load testing, torque measurements, and \nalignment verification. Structural health monitoring (SHM) systems incorporating \npiezometers, tiltmeters, and strain gauges should be installed for real -time monitoring of \ndisplacement, settlement, and structural response under hydraulic loading. These \ncomprehensive testing measures ensure that the weir maintains operational integrity and \nstructural resilience under dynamic flow conditions.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\nWeirs are considered important hydraulic structures, and although there are no specific \nstandards exclusively dedicated to weir integrity testing, several general standards and \nguidelines related to water control structures can be applied. These standards mainly \nfocus on aspects like structural integrity, hydraulic performance, and safety for all types of \nwater -related infrastructure, including dams, weirs, and spillways. Below are key \nstandards and guidelines that can be relevant for weir integrity testing in Malaysia:  \n \n1. Malaysian Standard (MS) 1195:2011 - Code of Practice for Earthworks in the \nUrban Environment  \nWhile this standard is mainly for earthworks, it also applies to structures like weirs, which \noften involve embankment and earth -fill construction. The standard outlines requirements \nfor construction quality, material testing, and monitoring of earthworks, which can be \nuseful when considering the foundations of a weir.  \nRelevant Sections:  \n• Soil Compaction and Material Integrity: MS 1195 specifies methods for soil \ncompaction and the required quality of materials used in the embankment, which is \ncrucial for the stability of weirs that rely on earth materials.  • Settlement Monitoring:  The standard recommends practices for settlement \nmonitoring that can be applied to monitor shifts or deformations in the earth \nstructures around weirs.  \n \n2. MS ISO 9001:2015 - Quality Management Systems  \nAlthough this is a general standard for quality management systems, its principles can be \napplied to the maintenance and integrity testing of weirs. MS ISO 9001 emphasizes \ncontinual improvement and risk management, both of which are critical when assessing \nthe safety and performance of hydraulic structures.  \nRelevant Sections:  \n• Inspection and Monitoring: Under MS ISO 9001, weir operators are required to \ninspect and monitor the performance of the structure, including aspects such as \nseepage, structural deformations, and hydraulic efficiency.  \n• Documenting Maintenance Activities: The standard mandates that inspections and \nintegrity tests be well -documented and traceable, ensuring accountability for the \ntesting and maintenance processes.  \n \n3. Malaysian Code of Practice for Structural Use of Concrete (MS 523:2005)  \nThis code of practice covers the design and construction of concrete structures, including \nweirs, particularly concrete weirs and spillways. It provides guidelines for structural \nintegrity testing of concrete components, which is a crucial aspect of weir safety.  \nRelevant Sections:  \n• Concrete Quality and Testing: The standard outlines the requirements for testing \nthe quality of concrete, such as compressive strength, crack resistance, and \nwatertightness. This applies to the weir structure itself, especially if it’s made of \nreinforced concrete.  \n• Inspection and Monitoring: MS 523 specifies methods for the visual inspection and \nNDT (non -destructive testing) of concrete surfaces to detect cracks or defects in \nthe structure.  \n \n4. Jabatan Pengairan dan Saliran (JPS) Guidelines  \nJPS (Department of Irrigation and Drainage) under the Ministry of Water, Land, and \nNatural Resources provides guidelines for water resources management, including the \ndesign, construction, and maintenance of weirs and similar structures.  \nKey Aspects:  \n• Maintenance and Inspection Protocols: JPS guidelines provide general protocols \nfor regular maintenance and safety inspections of hydraulic structures, including \nweirs. This involves both visual inspections and more advanced instrumental \nmonitoring.  \n• Seepage and Erosion Control: JPS guidelines specifically focus on the prevention \nof seepage and erosion, which are critical to the safety of weirs.  \n• Hydraulic Performance Monitoring: JPS also emphasizes the need to regularly \ncheck hydraulic performance, including flow measurement and ensuring that the \nweir is functioning within the expected range.  \n \n5. International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD) Guidelines  \nThe ICOLD provides best practices and guidelines for dam safety that can be applied to \nsimilar hydraulic structures, such as weirs. ICOLD guidelines emphasize the need for \nsafety assessments, regular testing, and monitoring of water -retaining structures.  \nKey Areas in ICOLD Guidelines:  \n• Safety Assessments: ICOLD emphasizes that a safety assessment of a weir \nshould include structural testing, hydraulic evaluations, and seepage monitoring.  • Monitoring and Maintenance: ICOLD guidelines suggest implementing a \nmonitoring system that tracks the performance of the weir, particularly during high -\nflow events or significant weather changes.  \n \n6. Malaysian Standard (MS 2446:2012) - Design and Installation of Embedded \nGround Instrumentation  \nThis standard focuses on the design and installation of instrumentation to monitor the \nintegrity of structures, including weirs. It covers the use of various geotechnical \ninstruments to monitor stress, strain, and displacement in the soil and structure.  \nRelevant Sections:  \n• Piezometers: This standard provides guidelines for the installation of piezometers \nto measure pore water pressure, which is crucial for monitoring seepage in weir \nfoundations and surrounding areas.  \n• Inclinometers and Displacement Monitoring: It also outlines how inclinometers and \nother instruments can be used to measure displacement and detect deformations \nin the structure over time.  \n \n7. The Manual for Safety of Dams (JPS Guidelines)  \nThe JPS Manual for Safety of Dams is a comprehensive document that provides safety \nguidelines for all types of dams and water management structures, including weirs. While \nmore focused on larger dams, many of the safety principles apply to weirs as well.  \nKey Guidelines:  \n• Regular Inspections and Testing: The manual mandates that safety and integrity \ninspections of weirs should be conducted on a regular basis and whenever \nsignificant changes occur (e.g., after floods).  \n• Hydrological Monitoring: It also suggests ongoing hydrological assessments to \nensure that water levels are controlled and that the structure can handle high -\nwater events.  \n• Failure Modes and Risk Assessments: The manual emphasizes the importance of \nperforming failure mode analyses and risk assessments to predict potential \nproblems and take pre -emptive action.  \n \n8. Department of Irrigation and Drainage (DID) - Guidelines for Hydrological and \nHydraulic Design of Weirs  \nThis set o f guidelines from the Department of Irrigation and Drainage (DID) provides best \npractices for the design and hydraulic performance of weirs, ensuring that they meet \nsafety requirements.  \nKey Areas:  \n• Flow Capacity and Performance Tests: The guidelines emphasize regular flow \ncapacity tests to ensure that the weir is functioning correctly and not obstructing \nwater flow.  \n• Seepage and Erosion: Specific guidelines are given for monitoring seepage \naround the weir structure and taking corrective measures for any signs of erosion \nor degradation.",

    "content": "Section 5.11: DUST EXTRACTION SYSTEM\n\nOBSERVATION:\nIt was noted that the environment inside the furniture production area is dusty, which \nindicates that the dust extraction system may not be functioning properly or is poorly \nmaintained .\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nA dust extraction system is an engineered solution designed to capture, transport, filter, \nand remove dust and airborne particulates generated during industrial processes. It is \nessential in industries such as woodworking, metalworking, food processing, and \nmanufacturing to maintain a clean and safe working environment, prevent health hazards, \nand protect equipment from dust accumulation.  \n \nIt is recommended to conduct a thorough inspection and testing of the dust extraction \nsystem to identify potential malfunctions or maintenance deficiencies. This should include \nchecking the integrity of ductwork, ensuring that the extraction fan is operating at the \ncorrect capacity, and confirming that dust filters are not clogged or damaged. Regular \nmaintenance should be scheduled according to manufacturer recommendations and \nrelevant guidelines such as the MS and DOSH standards. Additionally, monitoring dust \nlevels within the production area using appropriate measuring instruments is advised to \nensure that the dust extraction system maintains air quality within permissible limits. \nProper training for workers on the use and maintenance of the system, as well as periodic \nperformance audits, should also be implemented to sustain the effectiveness of the dust \nextraction system.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\nDust extraction systems in industrial settings, including furniture manufacturing, are \ngoverned by various regulations and standards to minimize fire and explosion risks, \nimprove air quality, and ensure worker safety. Furniture manufacturing generates \nsubstantial amounts of fine dust from cutting, sanding, and processing wood, which can \ncreate hazardous conditions if not properly controlled. Key guidelines and standards \naddressing dust extraction systems include:  \n \n1. Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) 1994 (Act 514)  \nThe OSHA  Act 1994  establishes the general duty of employers to ensure a safe working \nenvironment, which includes the control of airborne contaminants such as wood dust.  \nRelevant Sections:  \n• Section 15: General duties of employers to provide and maintain a safe working \nenvironment, including safe air quality.  \n• Section 16: Requirement for a written safety policy where dust extraction systems \nare necessary due to exposure to hazardous materials.  \n• Section 24: General duties of employees to comply with safety measures, \nincluding proper use of dust extraction systems.  \n \nApplication to Dust Extraction:  \n• Employers are required to implement suitable engineering controls, such as local \nexhaust ventilation (LEV), to capture dust at the source.  \n• Employers must regularly inspect and maintain dust extraction systems to ensure \nthey operate effectively.  \n \n 2. Factories and Machinery Act (FMA) 1967 (Act 139)  \nThe FM Act 1967  regulates the design, installation, and maintenance of machinery and \nequipment used in manufacturing facilities, including dust extraction systems.  \nRelevant Regulations:  \n• Section 18: Requires that machinery and systems generating airborne \ncontaminants (such as wood dust) must be equipped with proper ventilation and \nextraction systems.  \n• Safety, Health and Welfare Regulations 1970: Stipulates that dust extraction \nsystems must be installed and maintained to minimize worker exposure to \nhazardous dust.  \nApplication to Dust Extraction:  \n• Dust extraction systems must meet minimum air quality and capture efficiency \nrequirements.  \n• Systems must be capable of controlling the spread of dust to prevent inhalation \nrisks and potential dust explosions.  \n \n3. Malaysian Standard MS 1436: 2017 – Code of Practice for Local Exhaust \nVentilation (LEV)  \nMS 1436  outlines the best practices for the design, installation, operation, and \nmaintenance of local exhaust ventilation (LEV) systems, including dust extraction \nsystems.  \nKey Requirements:  \n• Design Requirements:  \no LEV systems must be designed to capture dust at the source before it \ndisperses into the work environment.  \no Hood design, ductwork, and fan capacity must be properly specified based \non the type and volume of dust generated.  \n• Airflow and Capture Efficiency:  \no Minimum airflow rates and static pressure requirements must be calculated \nbased on the dust particle size and material type.  \no Typical airflow for wood dust extraction is around 20 –30 m/s (metres per \nsecond) at the capture point.  \n• Filtration and Exhaust:  \no Systems should use high -efficiency filters (e.g., HEPA filters) to trap fine \ndust particles.  \no Clean, filtered air should be vented outside the building or recirculated with \nproper filtration.  \n• Inspection and Maintenance:  \no Regular testing (e.g., every 6 months) of airflow, pressure drop, and \ncapture efficiency.  \no Documentation of system performance and any repairs or adjustments \nmade.",

    "title": "SURGE PROTECTION DEVICE AT PV SOLAR FARM",
    "content": "Section 5.12: SURGE PROTECTION DEVICE AT PV SOLAR FARM\n\nOBSERVATION:\nBased on the single line diagram, it was noted that no surge protection devices (SPDs) \nare installed on either the DC or AC side of the system. This presents a significant risk to \nthe photovoltaic (PV) solar farm, as it increases the vulnerability of critical components —\nsuch as PV strings, inverters, combiner boxes, transformers, and monitoring systems —to \ntransient overvoltage caused by lightning strikes, switching surges, and grid disturbances. \nThe absence of SPDs can lead to insulation breakdown, damage to electronic \ncomponents, reduced operational efficiency, and potential downtime.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nA Surge Protection Device (SPD) is a critical component in electrical systems, engineered \nto safeguard electrical and electronic equipment from transient overvoltage resulting from \nlightning strikes, switching operations, and grid disturbances. SPDs operate by rapidly \ndiverting or clamping excess voltage to a predefined safe threshold, thereby protecting \nsensitive components and maintaining the stability and integrity of the electrical network.  \n \nIt is technically recommended to install Type 1+2 SPDs on the DC side at the PV strings \nand combiner boxes to mitigate both direct lightning strikes and switching surges. On the \nAC side, Type 2 SPDs should be deployed at the inverter output and the main AC \ndistribution panel to counter grid -induced transients. For protection of sensitive monitoring \nand communication systems, installing Type 2 or Type 3 SPDs is advised to prevent data \ncorruption and operational failure. Proper coordination between different SPD types must \nbe established to ensure layered protection across the PV solar farm, minimizing let -\nthrough energy and optimizing response times. Furthermore, periodic testing and \nmaintenance of SPDs are essential to validate performance and sustain long -term system \nreliability.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\n1. IEC 61643 -31:2018 – Low-voltage Surge Protective Devices – Part 31: \nRequirements and Test Methods for SPDs for Photovoltaic Installations  \n• Scope (Clause 1): This section defines the applicability of the standard to SPDs \nintended for surge protection against indirect and direct effects of lightning or other \ntransient overvoltage  on the DC side of PV installations rated up to 1,500 V DC.   \n• Normative References (Clause 2): Lists the standards referenced within IEC \n61643 -31, providing a foundation for the requirements and test methods specified.  \n• Terms and Definitions (Clause 3): Establishes the terminology used throughout the \nstandard, ensuring clarity and consistency in the application of its provisions.  \n• Requirements (Clause 4): Outlines the performance characteristics and safety \nrequirements for SPDs, including parameters such as:  \no Maximum continuous operating voltage (Uc)  \no Nominal discharge current (In)  \no Voltage protection level (Up)  \no Operating duty tests  \no Environmental conditions  \n• Tests (Clause 5): Details the standard methods for testing SPDs to verify \ncompliance with the performance and safety requirements specified in Clause 4.  \n \n2.

    "title": "PARTIAL DISCHARGE (PD) FOR UNINTERRUPTIBLE POWER SUPPLY \n(UPS)",
    "content": "Section 5.14: PARTIAL DISCHARGE (PD) FOR UNINTERRUPTIBLE POWER SUPPLY \n(UPS)\n\nOBSERVATION:\nThe maintenance team detected increased noise and harmonic distortion in the UPS \noutput, along with elevated temperatures at cable joints and terminations. These signs \nindicated possible insulation degradation, which could lead to serious electrical failure. \nThe problem arose in a UPS data centre  that had been operating for more than two years \nwith no record of a partial discharge test being conducted.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nPartial discharge (PD) is a localized electrical discharge that occurs due to imperfections \nor damage in the insulation of high -voltage components in Uninterruptible Power Supply \n(UPS) systems. PD can take various forms, including internal discharge within solid \ninsulation, surface discharge along insulation surfaces, corona discharge in gaseous \ninsulation, and treeing caused by progressive electrical stress. PD testing is essential for \nUPS systems to detect early -stage insulation defects, assess insulation aging, and \nprevent catastrophic failures that could lead to system downtime or damage.  \nThere are several methods for detecting PD activity in UPS systems. Electrical PD \ndetection measures high -frequency current pulses using capacitive or inductive sensors, \nsuch as high -frequency current transformers (HFCT) and coupling capacitors. Ultrasonic \ndetection identifies high -frequency acoustic signals produced by PD using microphones or \nacoustic sensors, while UHF detection captures electromagnetic waves emitted by PD at \nultra-high frequencies. Optical detection uses light sensors to detect emissions from \ncorona and surface discharges. These methods allow for accurate identification of PD \nsources and the extent of insulation damage.  \n \nThe PD testing process for UPS systems involves five key steps. It starts with a pre -test \ninspection of components and installation of sensors at key points. During testing, voltage \nis applied incrementally to measure PD activity. Recorded data is analysed to determine \nPD inception voltage (PDIV), extinction voltage (PDEV), pulse magnitude, and repetition \nrate. Test results are compared to baseline data and industry standards, followed by \nrecommendations for corrective actions such as insulation repair, joint tightening, and \ncomponent replacement to prevent future failures.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\n1.

    "title": "CORROSION OF UNDERWATER BRIDGE PILINGS",
    "content": "Section 5.15: CORROSION OF UNDERWATER BRIDGE PILINGS\n\nOBSERVATION:\nA bridge located in a coastal area has been in operation for over 10 years. During a \nroutine underwater inspection, divers discovered signs of corrosion on the steel pilings, \nparticularly around the splash zone and at the welded joints. Ultrasonic thickness testing \nrevealed a 20% reduction in wall thickness, indicating progressive corrosion due to \nconstant exposure to saltwater and marine organisms. Some areas showed visible rust \nand pitting, raising concerns about the structural integrity of the bridge .\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nProper maintenance of underwater pilings is crucial to ensure the long -term structural \nintegrity and safety of the bridge, especially in a coastal environment where exposure to \nsaltwater accelerates corrosion. The discovery of corrosion around the splash zone and \nwelded joints indicates that protective measures are either insufficient or have deteriorated \nover time.  \n \nIt is recommended to apply an epoxy -based anti -corrosion coating to the affected areas to \nprovide a protective barrier against saltwater exposure. Installing sacrificial anodes and an \nimpressed current cathodic protection (ICCP) system can further prevent corrosion by \nredirecting corrosive currents away from the steel surface. Additionally, regular underwater \ninspections using remote -operated vehicles (ROVs) and ultrasonic testing should be \nscheduled every 2 to 3 years to monitor the condition of the pilings and assess the \neffectiveness of the protection systems. Proper maintenance not only extends the service \nlife of the bridge but also reduces the risk of structural failure, ensuring the safety of users \nand minimizing costly repairs.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\n1.

    "title": "STATIC ELECTRICITY DURING THE UNWINDING AND WINDING OF \nPLASTIC SHEETS",
    "content": "Section 5.16: STATIC ELECTRICITY DURING THE UNWINDING AND WINDING OF \nPLASTIC SHEETS\n\nOBSERVATION:\nA rotogravure printing machine in a plastic packaging factory has been operating for \nseveral years without an electrostatic eliminator. The machine prints high -speed plastic \nfilm rolls used for food packaging. During the printing process, the plastic film unwinds and \npasses over multiple rollers at high speeds, creating friction between the rollers and the \nplastic surface. This friction generates a significant buildup of static electricity on the \nplastic film surface\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nManaging static electricity during the unwinding and winding of plastic sheets is essential \nto ensure product quality, operational efficiency, and safety. Static charges accumulate \ndue to friction, separation, and contact with machine components, leading to issues such \nas dust attraction, material misalignment, o perator shocks, and potential fire hazards in \nflammable environments.   \n \nAs such, it is recommended that:  \n1. Installation of Static Elimination Devices:  \no Ionizing Bars: Position ionizing bars at critical points, such as near unwind \nand rewind stations, to neut ralize static charges on the plastic film. This \nprevents dust attraction, reduces contamination, and minimizes operator \nshocks.  \no Ionizing Nozzles and Blowers: Utilize these devices to deliver ionized air \nonto specific areas of the film, effectively neutralizing static charges during \nprocesses like sheeting or bagging.  \n \n2. Proper Grounding and Conductive Pathways:  \no Ensure that all machinery components, including rollers and frames, are \nproperly grounded to provide a path for static dissipation. Ungrounded \ncondu ctive parts can accumulate charge, exacerbating static issues.  \n  \n3. Environmental Controls:  \no Humidity Control: Maintain optimal humidity levels within the production \nenvironment. Low humidity reduces air conductivity, increasing static \nbuildup. Using humidif iers can help mitigate this effect.  \n \n4. Material Handling Practices:  \no Antistatic Additives: Incorporate antistatic agents into plastic materials \nduring manufacturing to reduce their tendency to hold static charges.  \no Controlled Unwinding/Winding Speeds: Operate machinery at speeds that \nminimize friction and separation -induced static generation.  \n \n5. Regular Maintenance and Monitoring:  \no Equipment Inspection: Periodically inspect and clean rollers, ionizing \ndevices, and other components to ensure they function effec tively  \no Static Charge Monitoring: Use static meters to monitor charge levels on \nmaterials and equipment, allowing for timely intervention when high static \nlevels are detected.  \n \nBy implementing these measures, manufacturers can effectively control static electricity \nduring the unwinding and winding of plastic sheets, leading to improved product quality, enhanced safety, and increased operational efficiency.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\nManaging static electricity during the unwinding and winding of plastic sheet s is essential \nto ensure safety and maintain product quality. While there are no regulations exclusively \ndedicated to this specific process, several broader standards and guidelines address the \ncontrol of static electricity in industrial settings:  \n \n1. Nation al Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Guidelines  \nNFPA 77 – Recommended Practice on Static Electricity  \n• NFPA 77 is the key document addressing static electricity hazards across \nindustries.  \n• It provides detailed recommendations on identifying, evaluating, and mitigating \nstatic discharge risks.  \n• The guideline covers three key static control strategies:  \n \n(i) Grounding and Bonding:  \n• All metallic machine components, rollers, and frames involved in the plastic \nhandling process should be properly grounded to prevent charge buildup.  \n• Bonding ensures that all connected parts are at the same electrical potential, \npreventing spark discharge between surfaces.  \n \n(ii) Humidity Control:  \n• Static electricity generation increases in low humidity environments because dry \nair reduces the conductivity of the surrounding atmosphere.  \n• NFPA recommends maintaining a relative humidity of 50% to 65% to reduce static \ncharge accumulation on plastic surfaces.  \n \n(iii) Use of Antistatic Devices:  \n• Installation of ionization bars or ionizing blowers at winding and unwinding stations \nhelps to neutralize surface charges by introducing balanced positive and negative \nions into the air.  \n• Antistatic tinsel or grounded brushes can also be used to dissipate static charges.  \n \nApplication to Plastic Sheet Handling:  \n• Install ionization bars or blowers near the winding/unwinding points.  \n• Maintain controlled humidity within the processing area.  \n• Ensure that all components involved in the processing are grounded and bonded.  \n  \n \n2. MS 1979:2007 - Electrical Installations of Buildings - Code of Practice  \nThis Malaysian Standard offers guidelines for low voltage electrical installations in \nbuildings, emphasizing safety measures to protect against electrical hazards. While its \nprimary focus is on building electrical systems, several provisions are relevant to \ncontrolling static electricity during industrial processes, including the handling of plastic \nsheets  \n \nKey Provisions:  \n• Earthing (Grounding ) of Equipment: Ensures all electrical installations are properly \ngrounded to prevent the ac cumulation of static charges, thereby reducing the risk \nof electrical shocks and fires.  \n• Insulation of Live Conductors: Requires that all live conductors be insulated with \nmaterials like polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or cross -linked polyethylene (XLPE) to \nprevent direct contact and potential static discharge.   • Use of Barriers or Enclosures: Recommends implementing physical barriers or \nenclosures to prevent unintended contact with live parts, which can be a source of \nstatic electricity.   \n \nApplication to Plastic  Sheet Handling:  \nWhile MS 1979:2007 is tailored for building electrical installations, its emphasis on \nproper grounding and insulation can be applied to machinery  used in the unwinding \nand winding of plastic sheets. Ensuring that all equipment is adequately grounded and \ninsulated can significantly reduce the buildup of static electricity during these \nprocesses.  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nList of References  List of references  \n1) OSHA Regulations (Standard – 29 CFR):  \nhttps://www.osha.gov/laws -regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910  \n2) Hazardous Chemical Safe Storage Compliance:  \nhttps://www.safetyinfo.com/safe -chemical -storage -osha -requirements -free-\nindex/  \n3) Control of Industrial Major Accident Hazard Regulation in Malaysia:  \nhttps://www.researchgate.net/publication/368692141_Control_of_industrial_m\najor_accident_hazard_regulation_in_Malaysia_second_decade_in_examinati\non#:~:text=The%20Control%20of%20Industrial%20Major,major%20hazard%2\n0risks%20are%20taken . \n4) Guidelines For Industrial Gas Cylinder 2021_JKKP:  \nhttps://oshe.uthm.edu.my/images/document/Biosafety/GUIDELINES_FOR_IN\nDUSTRIAL_GAS_CYLINDER%202021_JKKP.pdf  \n5) IEEE/ASHRAE Guide for the Ventilation and Thermal Management of \nBatteries for Stationary Applications : \nhttps://webstore.ansi.org/preview -\npages/ASHRAE/preview_IEEE+Std+1635TM -2018+ASHRAE+Guideline+21 -\n2018.pdf?srsltid=AfmBOooCphih3rOZJsyyIg6R -\nZzQtEnedgDmIggNPlhmxkDNErPs84 -j \n6) Guideline on Gas Piping System:  \nhttps://www.st.gov.my/en/contents/files/download/96/Guidelines_On_Gas_Pipi\nng_Systems_At_Laundrettes_And_Similar_Installations.pdf  \n7) Occupation Safety and health Standard 1910.178 Material Handling and \nStorage:  \nhttps://www.osha.gov/laws -\nregs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.178#:~:text=Battery%20charging\n%20installations%20shall%20be%20located%20in%20areas%20designated\n%20for%20that%20purpose.&text=Facilities%20shall%20be%20provided%20\nfor,of%20fumes%20from%20gassing%20batteries . \n8) Non-Domestic Electrical Installation Safety Code:  \nhttps://www.osha.gov/laws -\nregs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.178#:~:text=Battery%20charging\n%20installations%20shall%20be%20located%20in%20areas%20designated\n%20for%20that%20purpose.&text=Facilities%20shall%20be%20provided%20\nfor,of%20fumes%20from%20gassing%20batteries . \n9) Occupation Safety and health Standard 1910.252 Welding, Cutting and \nBrazing:  https://www.osha.gov/laws -regs/regulations/standardnumber/1910/1910.252  \n10) The Geotechnical Design Guidelines by JKR (Jabatan Kerja Raya)  \nhttp://epsmg.jkr.gov.my/images/c/c3/GEOTECHNICAL_DESIGN_GUIDELINE\nS.pdf  \n11) National Landscape Policy:  \nhttps://www.jln.gov.my/jln/resources/user_1/Text%20Documents/Dokumen%2\n0Penerbitan/Dasar%20Landskap%20Negara/dln_bi.pdf  \n12) Specification for Load Bearing Block Work System (JKR 20601 -0252 -18):  \nhttp://epsmg.jkr.gov.my/images/d/db/Specification_For_Load_Bearing_Blockw\nork_System_JKR_20601 -0252 -18.pdf  \n13) Wind Load Consideration in Structural Design:  \nhttps://ipm.my/wind -load-consideration -in-structural -design/  \n14) National Electrical Code (NEC) 110.26 -
