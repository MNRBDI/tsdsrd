    "text": "Category: PERILS\nSection: 1.8 - WINDSTORM\n\nObservation:\nThe Administration, Academic, and Library Building (1 OP) has experienced multiple \nincidents of wind damage to the strip ceilings at the roof level. In September 2023, a \nsignificant wind event caused one strip ceiling to be blown away and damaged several \nothers. According to the participant, similar incidents have occurred on multiple occasions \npreviously but were not reported to the takaful operator. After each event, the damaged \nstrip ceiling was replaced without further investigation or mitigation measures. \n \nThis repetitive pattern of damage highlights the inadequacy of current construction and \nmaintenance practices, suggesting the need for a more comprehensive and proactive \napproach to managing wind-induced risks. \n \nThe following risk assessments should be carried out to identify any possible and inherent \ncauses arises from the event: \n \n1)  Vulnerability to Strong Winds: \n• \nThe building's roof and strip ceiling structures are highly exposed to strong wind \nforces, especially during stormy weather conditions. \n• \nThe design and construction of the strip ceilings may not be adequate to withstand \nhigh wind pressures, leading to repeated failures. \n• \n \n2)  Potential Consequences: \n• \nStructural damage to the building due to compromised ceilings. \n• \nPotential safety hazards to occupants and pedestrians due to falling debris. \n• \nIncreased financial losses from repeated repairs and replacements. \n• \nPotential reputational damage and increased insurance premiums if incidents \npersist.\n\nRecommendation:\nWe recommend that a more comprehensive and proactive approach be taken instead of \nmerely replacing the damaged strip ceilings after each incident.

They are \nthe result of localized overheating within the breaker panel or box. Typically, these marks \noccur due to loose or corroded components and connections, which introduce resistance \nand cause excessive heat generation. Burn marks aren’t just a cosmetic issue; they are a \nwarning of impending danger. These marks can be a precursor to electrical shorts, \npotentially leading to electrical fires or even electric shocks if left unattended. \nAs such, it is recommended that the circuit breaker: \n \n1. Tighten all wire connections to the circuit breaker. Loose electrical connections \nat the breaker or on the wires connected to it can create resistance. This \nresistance in the circuit leads to heat buildup, which can cause burning or charring \nat the connection points. \n2. Replace faulty breakers with new, properly rated ones. A malfunctioning or aged \ncircuit breaker might fail to trip during an overload or short circuit, causing heat to \naccumulate and burn marks to appear. \n3. Investigate the circuit to identify and fix any short circuits. This may involve \nchecking wiring and outlets for faults, replacing damaged wires, or inspecting \nappliances that may have caused the short. A large current surge can generate \nsignificant heat, causing the circuit breaker to overheat and resulting in burn marks \nor charring around the breaker area. \n4. Ensure that the total electrical load on the circuit does not exceed the breaker’s \nrating. If necessary, redistribute the load across other circuits or upgrade to a \nhigher-rated breaker.

Designate Fire-Safe Storage Areas \n• \nSeparate Combustible Materials: Materials that are highly combustible, such as \nmattresses or expanded foam should be stored in designated areas away from \nother less hazardous items. This prevents the spread of fire to non-flammable \ngoods and helps ensure that fire risks are contained in one area. In some \ncases, it may be necessary to install fire-resistant partitions or barriers to \nfurther limit the risk of fire spreading from one storage area to another. These \n\nbarriers help contain a fire to a small zone, allowing staff more time to evacuate \nand control the situation. \n• \nClear Separation of Storage Zones: The storage area should be clearly marked \nto differentiate between safe and fire-hazard zones. For instance, use clearly \nvisible signage to indicate fire hazard areas where flammable materials are \nstored, and ensure these areas are kept free from unnecessary items that \ncould act as fuel in the event of a fire.",

Improve LPG Cylinder Storage: \n• \nStore LPG cylinders in a well-ventilated area, away from any sources of heat, and \nensure they are properly secured to prevent accidental tipping. \n• \nInstall gas leak detection systems and automatic shutoff valves for early detection \nof leaks and to minimize the impact of any leaks. \n3. Install Fire Suppression Systems: \n• \nImplement a wet chemical fire suppression system (especially if deep fryers or \nopen flame cooking are used). \n• \nEnsure portable fire extinguishers (Class B) are readily available and easily \naccessible. \nAlternatively, the cooking activity is moved from current location into the staff quarters \n(dedicated for JBR Bundle, one the building tenant) at the left side of Building A.  \n \n\n \nStaff quarter",

Regular \nmaintenance should be scheduled according to manufacturer recommendations and \nrelevant guidelines such as the MS and DOSH standards. Additionally, monitoring dust \nlevels within the production area using appropriate measuring instruments is advised to \nensure that the dust extraction system maintains air quality within permissible limits. \nProper training for workers on the use and maintenance of the system, as well as periodic \nperformance audits, should also be implemented to sustain the effectiveness of the dust \nextraction system.",
