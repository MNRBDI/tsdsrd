However, there is  \nsometimes combustible paper -based  stocks are stored at this area . \n \n \nArea designated as smoking area, but also utilized to store goods\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nCombustible paper -based stocks are sometimes stored at the shed area near to the \ndesignated smoking area , posing a fire hazard if smoking is allowed in or near these areas. \nSparks, cigarette butts, or improperly discarded smoking materials could easily ignite these \nmaterials, causing fires that could spread to nearby structures or equipment.  \n \nRecommendation:  \nTo mitigate this risk, it is strongly recommended that:  \n1. Smoking Ban:  Strictly prohibit smoking in and around areas where combustible \npaper -based materials are stored.  \n2. Designated Smoking Area:  Establish a controlled and clearly marked designated \nsmoking area at a safe distance from storage areas and buildings.  \n3. Signage and Communication:  Install visible signage to inform employees and \nvisitors about the smoking restrictions and the location of the designated smoking \narea.  \n4. Monitoring and Enforcement:  Implement regular checks to ensure compliance with \nthe smoking policy and enforce disciplinary actions for violations if necessary.  \n5. Fire-Safe Disposal Facilities:  Provide fire -safe receptacles for the proper disposal \nof cigarette butts and smoking -related materials in the designated smoking area.  \n \nBy implementing these measures, the risk of fire caused by smoking in or near combustible \nmaterial storage areas can be significantly reduced, protecting both the facility and its \noccupants.\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\n1. Fire Services Act 1988 (Act 341):  Section 27: Empowers the Fire and Rescue Department to enforce measures preventing fire \nhazards, including controlling ignition sources near combustible materials.  \n \n2. Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994 (OSHA 1994):  \nSection 15: Mandates employers to ensure the safety, health, and welfare of employees, \nnecessitating policies that mitigate fire risks, such as prohibiting smoking near combustible \nmaterials.  \n \n3. Smoking Products Control for Public Health Act 2024 (Act 852):  \nDesignates specific areas as non -smoking zones to protect public health, including \nworkplaces and areas where combustible materials are present.  \n \n4.
