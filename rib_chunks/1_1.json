They emphasize the importance of monitoring ground movements to ensure \nstructural safety and integrity.  \n \nThe Geotechnical Design Guidelines by JKR (Jabatan Kerja Raya) provide a \ncomprehensive framework for managing geotechnical risks, including subsidence. These \nguidelines emphasize assessing, monitoring, and mitigating ground movement to ensure \nthe safety and stability of structures.  \n \nBelow is an outline of the relevant sections related to subsidence:  \n \nGround Investigation Requirements  \n• Conduct thorough soil investigations to identify soil properties, including \ncompressibility, shear strength, and permeability.  \n• Borehole drilling and sampling should be done at strategic locations to assess \nsubsurface conditions that may influence settlement.  \n• Lab testing, including consolidation tests, should be conducted to estimate \nsettlement rates and magnitude  \n \nMonitoring of Movements  \n• Regularly monitor settlement and subsidence using geotechnical instruments such \nas settlement markers  and piezometers.",
