  "content": "Section 4.5: COOKING FACILITIES\n\nOBSERVATION:\nNoted that there is a cooking activity utilising LPG cylinder gas located at the rear side of \nthe building. The room where the cooking activity is conducted is  not separated by a \nproper fire break wall  from the adjacent furniture showroom. This poses significant risks in \nthe event of a fire, as the fire could easily spread from the cooking area to the showroom, \ncausing substantial property damage, potential injury, or loss of life.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nThe risks associated with the cooking activity utilizing  LPG cylinders  in the absence of \nproper fire separation are significant, particularly with regards to fire spread, explosion \nhazards, and the potential for severe property and life damage.  \n \nAs such, it is recommended that,  \n1. Install Fire Break Wall:  \n• Construct a  fire-rated wall  (minimum 1 -hour fire resistance) between the cooking \narea and the furniture showroom to prevent the spread of fire. Fire -rated doors \nshould also be installed in this partition.  \n2. Improve LPG Cylinder Storage:  \n• Store  LPG cylinders  in a well -ventilated area, away from any sources of heat, and \nensure they are properly secured to prevent accidental tipping.  \n• Install  gas leak detection systems  and automatic shutoff valves  for early detection \nof leaks and to minimize the impact of any leaks.  \n3. Install Fire Suppression Systems:  \n• Implement a  wet chemical fire suppression system  (especially if deep fryers or \nopen flame cooking are used).  \n• Ensure  portable fire extinguishers  (Class B) are readily available and easily \naccessible.  \nAlternatively, the cooking activity is moved from current location into the staff quarters \n(dedicated for JBR Bundle, one the building tenant) at the left side of Building A.  \n  \nStaff quarter\n\nREGULATION/GUIDELINE:\nNot applicable",
